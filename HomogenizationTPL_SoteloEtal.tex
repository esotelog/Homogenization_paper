\begin{abstract}
Seismic-scale thin layers of interest often present prominent mechanical contrasts with the embedding background and, hence, are important targets for seismic reflection studies.
An efficient way to study the reflectivity response of a porous thin layer is to employ its homogenized viscoelastic equivalent.
We aim to homogenize a simple, yet realistic thin layer model that consists of a stack of few porous beds with distinct properties that is embedded in a background deemed impermeable for the seismic frequency range, with the overall goal of reproducing its reflectivity response.
Such model allows representing thin layers of interest that are relevant in subsurface applications.  
However, due to to the lack of periodicity of the stack of beds forming the thin layer, the estimation of its equivalent moduli is inherently affected by the boundary conditions (BC) associated with the embedding background and, therefore, classical homogenization procedures are not readily applicable. Thus, we propose to account for the appropriate BC in the homogenization procedure.
Classical methodologies perform oscillatory relaxation tests over a representative sample of the periodic structure, followed by the averaging of stress and strain components, to finally estimate the equivalent moduli. We adapt this procedure as follows: we apply the oscillatory relaxation tests on a sample that includes part of the background while the averaging of stress and strain components is performed only over the thin layer section. To test the proposed method, we consider a thin layer that is composed by a stack of two porous sand beds, where the upper one is CO$_2$-saturated and the bottom one is water-saturated and that is embedded in elastic half-spaces. Then, after estimating the corresponding moduli using the proposed homogenization procedure, we compare the P-wave reflectivities obtained using the homogenized medium against the ones obtained using the porous thin layer. 
Results show that the homogenized medium closely reproduce the reflectivities of the porous thin layer in the seismic frequency range with errors below 3 \%. This methodology can be readily extended to porous thin layers presenting strongly heterogenous structures such as inclusions or fractures.
\end{abstract}

\section*{Plain Language Summary}
Thin layers in the seismic scale embedded in impermeable background are of significance for underground applications such as carbon sequestration or hydrocarbon exploitation. The strong contrast in mechanical properties that, in many cases, these layers present in comparison to the background rock makes them suitable for seismic reflection studies. A simplified technique to study the seismic response of a porous medium is to use its viscoelastic equivalent obtained after a homogenization procedure. Our goal is to  homogenize  a thin layer model that consists of a stack of few porous beds with distinct physical and that is embedded in impermeable background,  with the aim to reproduce its seismic reflection response. This model yet simple is, nonetheless, useful to depict thin layers of interest.
However, traditional homogenization procedures of porous media presenting an ordered arrangement of heterogeneities rely on the existence of a periodic unit, for instance, a stack of beds that repeats sufficiently so that the boundary conditions of the surrounding medium does not affect the estimation of the equivalent moduli. Since the considered thin layer model does not comply with this requirement, we adapt traditional procedures in order to incorporate the influence of the boundary conditions associated with the background on the estimation of the equivalent moduli. We test the proposed method using a thin layer composed of a stack of two distinct porous sand beds. The results show that the corresponding equivalent moduli obtained using the proposed homogenization procedure
 are capable to satisfactory reproduce the reflectivity response of the porous thin layer.

\section{Introduction}
Quantitative interpretation of seismic reflection data is a valuable tool to characterize rock and fluid properties.
This is particular relevant for the characterization of small-scale geological features in comparison to the predominant wavelength such as seismic-scale thin layers. In this regard,
a layer is considered to be thin if the reflections from the top and bottom interfaces cannot be individually resolved by the predominant wavelength, such that their compounded effect manifests itself as a single seismic reflection signal \cite{Widess1973}. This effect occurs when the layer thickness is equal to or smaller than a quarter of the dominant wavelength \cite{Widess1973, Kallweit1982}.
The corresponding threshold is known as the tuning thickness and is characterized by an initial constructive interference of the reflection signals from the top and bottom interfaces that becomes destructive as the layer thickness decreases \cite{Bakke1998, Hamlyn2014}.
Pertinent applications of reflectivity studies on thin layers are, for instance,  the characterization of gas-bearing beds \cite<e.g.,>{Cichostepski2019, Shakir2022}
as well as the monitoring of carbon sequestration \cite<e.g.,>{Williams2012,Zhang2013}. In general, proposed methodologies to estimate thin layer properties are largely developed in the frequency domain \cite<e.g.,>{Puryear2008,Rubino2009a,Zhang2013, Romdhane2014, Huang2016} and they are mainly applied in a pure elastic framework. This approach is likely to affect the accuracy of the estimated properties since the elastic theory cannot account for fluid-solid interactions in heterogenoues porous rocks.

Conversely, using  a poroelastic framework allows for an accurate physical description of heterogenous porous rocks saturated with different fluids as they are commonly encountered in thin layers of interest. In particular, evidence suggests that heterogenoues porelastic media
exhibit an equivalent viscoelastic behavior regarding attenuation and velocity dispersion in the seismic frequency range. \cite<e.g.,>{Pride2004, Carcione2006}. This dispersive behavior is the consequence of an energy dissipation phenomenon known as wave-induced fluid flow or WIFF \cite<e.g.,>{Muller2010} that occurs when a passing seismic wave generates pressure gradients between different parts of a poroelastic medium
that equilibrate by fluid flow.
For typical frequencies used in seismic experiments, WIFF occurs predominantly in the mesoscale range \cite<e.g.,>{Pride2004, Muller2010}. This refers to  WIFF taking place  between  heterogeneities that are larger than the prevailing pore size  but smaller than the wavelength \cite<e.g.,>{Norris1993}. In this context, the substitution of a heterogeneous thin layer by its homogenized viscoelastic representation can be deemed as an efficient technique to study its seismic reflectivity. Indeed, published work
shows the applicability of the poroelastic-to-viscoelastic homogenization approach to frequency-dependent seismic reflection studies of thin layers. For instance, \citeA{Rubino2011} and \citeA{Rubino2011a} employ viscoelastic substitutes to represent thin sand layers with different patchy saturations of CO$_2$ to investigate the corresponding effects on zero-offset seismic reflection data as well as on
the variation of amplitudes for different incident angles. Similarly,
\citeA{He2020} use viscoelastic substitutes of thin fractured layers to investigate their effect on P-wave amplitude variation with respect to the incident angle and frequency. Moreover, \citeA{Jin2017} use an equivalent viscoelastic representation to replace a partially gas-saturated thin layer. This model is later used to estimate gas saturation and layer thickness from seismic amplitude variation with the incident angle and frequency.

The pioneering work of \citeA{White1975a} and \citeA{White1975} is one of the first to show the equivalent viscoelastic behavior of simple poroelastic composites saturated with gas and water. Specially, the periodic model of alternating  porous beds  \cite{White1975} has been used to represent thin layers. 
In this modeling approach, the porous thin layer is assumed to be embedded in an impermeable background and to consist of a stack of periodically-repeating alternating beds that are deemed poroelastic, homogeneous and isotropic. This hydraulically isolated thin layer model is useful to represent relevant scenarios for subsurface applications such as the case of a porous sandstone thin layer  surrounded by impervious shale \cite<e.g.,>{Torres-verdin2012,AbuEl-Ata2019}, or the scenario of a narrow fractured or damage zone,  embedded in impermeable intact rock \cite<e.g.,>{Caine1996, Mitchell2012}. Several studies have applied the aforementioned model to investigate the frequency-dependent reflectivity response of thin layers of interest. In this regard, this thin layer representation with alternating beds is convenient for testing the sensitivity of various poroelastic parameters as it allows the computation of its equivalent moduli by analytical means \cite<e.g.,>{Carcione2006, Krzikalla2011}.
For instance, \citeauthor{Quintal2009} \citeyear{Quintal2009, Quintal2011a}
%\citeA{Quintal2009} %and \citeA{Quintal2011a}
compare the frequency-dependent reflection coefficients at normal incidence of viscoelastic substitutes of thin layer models embedded in elastic background that consist of a stack of periodically-repeating
alternating porous sands with different rock and fluid properties. Whereas, \citeA{He2020} utilize a particular version of this model to represent a thin layer containing fractures. In this case, they consider that the thin layer is embedded in impervious shale and that one of its alternating beds represents a horizontal fracture with a much higher permeability, softer moduli and smaller thickness  than the other bed \cite{Brajanovski2005,Kong2013}. In their study, they use viscoelastic substitutes of these fractured thin layers to examine the effect of various saturating fluids and fracture properties on the variation of seismic amplitude as a function of the angle of incidence and frequency. Nonetheless, a general assumption in the homogenization of porous medium containing a deterministic heterogeneous structure is its periodicity, for example, an ensemble of beds that repeats a sufficient number of times so that its
equivalent behavior is, for practical purposes, unaffected by the boundary conditions (BC) induced by the surrounding rock. However, a more realistic and flexible way to depict a porous thin layer with an internal bedding structure is to consider a model consisting of a stack of few porous beds with distinct rock and fluid properties. However, in such case, boundary effects associated with the background embedding the thin layer inherently affect its equivalent moduli. While, classical homogenization procedures are not readily applicable to this type of thin layer models, the development of a suitable procedure has been largely unexplored.

In this work, we seek to alleviate this problem by proposing a method to homogenize a porous thin layer consisting of a stack of non-periodic beds that is embedded in a background deemed impermeable for the frequencies of interest, with the overall goal of adequately predicting its reflectivity. Classical homogenization procedures of periodic poroelastic media apply oscillatory relaxation tests to a representative sample of the periodic structure. This is followed by the averaging of the stress and the strain components over the sample to estimate the equivalent moduli. We adapt this methodology to incorporate in the estimation of equivalent moduli the influence of the BC induced by the embedding background.
In the Methodology section, we describe this proposed homogenization procedure that presents the following central modifications with respect to classical methods. First, it applies the corresponding oscillatory tests to a sample that incorporates part of the impermeable background and a representative section of the 
thin layer and, second, it performs the averaging of stress and strain components only over the thin layer section in order to find its equivalent moduli. In the Results section, we
test the accuracy of proposed method considering a thin layer model that consists of a stack of two  porous sand beds and that is embedded in half-spaces deemed impervious for the seismic frequencies. We estimate the corresponding equivalent moduli by applying the proposed homogenization procedure to then calculate P-wave reflectivities at the interface between the upper half-space and the equivalent representation of the thin layer. Finally, we compare these results against those obtained using the porous thin layer. In the Discussion section we investigate the impact that substituting the background by different BC has on the equivalent moduli. Besides, we also examine the implications of considering a permeable background.
 
\section{Theory and methods}
In this section we detail the proposed homogenization procedure to estimate the equivalent moduli of an infinite horizontal thin layer embedded in half-spaces that are deemed impermeable for the frequencies of interest. We assume that this thin layer-background system is defined in $\mathbb R^2$. 
In more detail, we consider that the thin layer consists of a stack of few distinct beds which are poroelastic, homogeneous and isotropic (Figure \ref{fig.1}a). 
The proposed homogenization procedure is based on the classical treatment described in \citeA{Favino2020} but incorporates substantial modifications with regards to
the extent of the sample considered as well as the volume over which strain and stress components are averaged. For the proposed method, the sample includes part of the embedding background and the corresponding section of the thin layer. Then, after applying the oscillatory test, the averaging of stress and strains is performed only over the domain pertaining to the thin layer.
These novel adaptations allow
incorporating naturally the effect of the BC induced by the embedding background in the estimation of the equivalent moduli of the thin layer model considered. 
On the other hand, reflectivity computations using the proposed poroelastic thin layer model  and its corresponding viscoelastic equivalent are detailed in Appendices A and B, respectively. Before presenting the proposed homogenization procedure,
we detail theoretical aspects regarding the validity of the poroelastic-to-viscoelastic equivalence.

\subsection{Mesoscale fluid pressure diffusion}
WIFF occurs when a seismic wave propagating through a heterogeneous poroelastic medium creates
pressure gradients that equilibrate by fluid flow \cite{Muller2010}.
We focus on WIFF that occurs between mesoscale heterogeneities since this is particularly relevant for seismic applications. Mesoscale heterogeneities refer to those with a characteristic size $L_m$ that are larger than the pore size $L_p$ but smaller than the wavelength $\lambda_w$. Specifically, for thin layers consisting of a stack of beds, the size of the mesoscale heterogeneity is dictated by the thickness of such beds.
For sufficiently low frequencies $f$, which are generally within the seismic range, the drag at the solid-fluid interface associated with WIFF is viscous-dominated \cite{Johnson1987} and, in such case, fluid pressure diffusion (FPD) is the mechanism driving WIFF \cite{Pride2005}. The reference frequency that indicates the transition of the drag effect from viscous towards inertial-dominated is Biot's characteristic frequency $f_B$ \cite{Biot1956, Dutta1979}
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.1}
f_B= \frac{1}{2 \pi} \frac{\eta \phi}{ \rho_f \kappa S },
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $\phi$ is the porosity, $\kappa$  the static permeability, $\eta$, the fluid viscosity,  $\rho_f$ the fluid density, and $S$ the tortuosity of the pore space. The aforementioned considerations regarding scales and frequencies that frame mesoscale WIFF driven by FPD can be summarized as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.2}
\begin{split}
 L_p & \ll L_m \ll \lambda_w, \\
f & \ll f_B.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

It can be shown that the equation governing this FPD mechanism stems from \citeauthor{Biot1941}'s \citeyear{Biot1941} quasi-static equations \cite{Dutta1979, Chandler1981, Norris1993}, where the corresponding diffusion coefficient $D$ together with its characteristic diffusion length $L_d$ can be expressed as \cite{Norris1993}
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.3}
\begin{split}
&D= \frac {\kappa} {\eta} \frac{M H_d}{H},\\
&L_d=\sqrt{\frac{D}{\omega}},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $M$ is Biot‚Äôs fluid storage modulus, $H_d$ and $H$ are the drained and undrained plane-wave moduli, respectively, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency $\omega = 2 \pi f$.
The required rock physical properties are
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.4}
\begin{split}
& H_d = \lambda_d + 2 \mu, \\
& H = H_d + M \alpha ^2, \\
& \lambda_d= K_m - \frac{2}{3} \mu, \\
& \alpha =1-\frac{K_m}{K_s},\\
& M  =\left( \frac{\alpha-\phi}{K_s} +\frac{\phi}{K_f} \right)^{-1},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $\lambda_d$ is the the drained Lam√© modulus, $\mu$ is the shear modulus, $\alpha$ is the Biot-Willis equivalent stress coefficient, $K_m$, $K_s$, and $K_f$ are the bulk moduli of the drained solid frame, the solid grains, and the pore fluid, respectively.

On the other hand, the wave-frequency, the characteristic diffusion length $L_d$  and the size of the heterogeneity $L_m$ control the relaxed and unrelaxed FPD regimes \cite{Muller2010}. The relaxed state occurs at sufficiently low frequencies, for which  $L_d \gg L_m$. In this regime, there is enough time for the pressure between the beds to equilibrate. Conversely, the unrelaxed state occurs at sufficiently high frequencies, for which $L_d \ll L_m$ and, consequently, there is insufficient time for pressure equilibration to take place and, hence, the different beds behave as hydraulically isolated. A transition zone exists at intermediate frequencies, for which $L_d \approx L_m$.
This zone is associated with attenuation and dispersion of body waves due to viscous dissipation. The maximum dissipation energy is related to a characteristic transition frequency $f_c= \omega_c/2\pi$, which depends on the diffusion coefficient $D$ and the characteristic size of the heterogeneity $L_m$ \cite{Muller2006}
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.5}
\omega_c \approx \frac{D}{(L_m)^2}.
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

The described FPD relaxation mechanism produces a viscoelastic behavior of the thin layer under consideration. The frequency-dependent moduli that describe such a viscoelastic material can be estimated by solving \citeauthor{Biot1941}'s \citeyear{Biot1941} quasi-static equations over a representative sample of the thin layer model (Figure \ref{fig.1}), while imposing relaxation oscillatory tests. This, in turn, is followed by volume averaging of the inferred strain and stress components that, are then used, to estimate the equivalent moduli. On the other hand, hereinafter we use the term FPD to refer specifically to the mechanism driving mesoscale WIFF forthe frequencies of interest, which are generally much lower than Biot's characteristic frequency.

\subsection{Proposed homogenization procedure}
We consider a thin layer that consists of a stack of few poroelastic beds, e.g. B1, B2, B3 and B4, that is embedded in the half-spaces $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$ which represent impermeable background for the frequencies of interest (Figure \ref{fig.1}a). To find the equivalent viscoelastic moduli of the thin layer, we apply the homogenization procedure described below over a sample $\Omega_e = \Omega_p \,\cup \, \Omega_b$ (Figure \ref{fig.1}b), where $\Omega_p$ denotes a representative section of the thin  layer and $\Omega_b =\Omega_{b1}\, \cup \, \Omega_{b2}$ is a portion of the background, with $\Omega_{b1} \subset \Lambda_1$ and $\Omega_{b2} \subset \Lambda_2$, respectively. As already stated, this sampling strategy allows incorporating naturally the boundary effects induced by the presence of the embedding background on the equivalent viscoelastic moduli.


\subsubsection{Governing equations}
We solve Biot's consolidation equations \cite{Biot1941, Biot1962} over a sample  $\Omega_e$ of the thin layer of interest (Figures \ref{fig.1}a and \ref{fig.1}b) for each of the oscillatory relaxation tests specified in equations
\eqref{Eq.8} to \eqref{Eq.11}. We express these equations in the solid displacement - pressure ($\bm{u}-p$) formulation in the frequency domain \cite{Quintal2011,Favino2020},  with $\bm{u} = \bm{u}(\bm{x}, \omega)$ and $p = p(\bm{x},\omega)$, where $\bm{x} \in \Omega_e$ is the position and $\omega \in F$ is the angular frequency, with $F =(0,W]$. 
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.6}
\begin{split}
& - \nabla \cdot \, \bm{\sigma} = \bm{0}  \quad  \textrm{in} \quad \Omega_e \times F,  \\
& - i \, \alpha \nabla . \, \bm{u} -i \frac{p}{M} + \frac{1}{\omega} \,\nabla \, \cdot \, \left( \frac{\kappa}{\eta} \nabla p\right)  =0 \quad  \textrm{in} \quad \Omega_e \times F,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $\bm{\sigma}$ is the total stress, $i$ is the imaginary unit.

The constitutive equation relating the total stress $\bm{\sigma}$ to $\bm{u}$ and $p$ is
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.7}
\begin{split}
& \bm{\sigma} =  2\mu \, \bm{\varepsilon} +  \left( \lambda_d \,  \tr( \bm{\varepsilon})\, - \alpha \,p \right) \bm{I}, \qquad \text{with}\\
& \bm{\varepsilon} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \nabla \,\bm{u} + ({\nabla  \bm{u}})^T  \right),
 \end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $\bm{\varepsilon}$ is the strain tensor,
and $\bm{I}$ the identity tensor. 

 
\subsubsection{Oscillatory relaxation tests}
In this subsection we detail the BC for the oscillatory relaxation tests. 
Hereinafter, we assume a Cartesian coordinate system in $\mathbb R^2$ with the associated basis vectors $\bm{\hat x_1}$ and $\bm{\hat x_3}$ parallel to the horizontal and vertical Cartesian axes, respectively. We also
let the sample $\Omega_e$ be a quadrilateral with boundary $\Gamma = \Gamma_1^+ \cup \Gamma_1^- \cup \Gamma_3^+ \cup \Gamma_3^- $, where $\Gamma_1^+ $ and $\Gamma_1^- $ are opposite boundaries with outer normal vectors $\bm{\hat x_1}$ and $ -\bm{\hat x_1}$, respectively. Similarly, $\Gamma_3^+ $ and $\Gamma_3^- $ are opposite boundaries with outer normal vectors $\bm{\hat x_3}$ and $ -\bm{\hat x_3}$ (Figure \ref{fig.1}b). To simplify the notation, we let $ \bm{\hat n}$ be the outer normal vector
of $\Gamma$.

In the following, we define periodic BC for displacements ($\bm{u}$), pressure ($p$), tractions ($\bm{\sigma}\cdot \bm{\hat n} $) and fluid flux relative to the solid ($\frac{\kappa}{\eta} \nabla p \cdot \bm{\hat n}$). We apply three different sets of displacement BC corresponding to the vertical and horizontal compression as well as the shear oscillatory relaxation tests. Here, we let $\Delta u$ be a real displacement difference in the frequency domain.

For the vertical compressional test, the BC for displacements are
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.8}
\begin{split}
&  \bm{u} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_3} \, \vert_{\Gamma_3^-} - \bm{u}\cdot \bm{\hat{x}_3}\, \vert_{\Gamma_3^+} =- \Delta u, \\
&  \bm{u} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_1}\, \vert_{\Gamma_3^-} - \bm{u} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_1} \, \vert_{\Gamma_3^+} = 0, \\
& \bm{u}\,\vert_{\Gamma_1^+} - \bm{u}\,\vert_{\Gamma_1^-} = \bm{0},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

For the horizontal compressional test, the BC for displacements are
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.9}
\begin{split}
& \bm{u} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_1}\, \vert_{\Gamma_1^+}-\bm{u} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_1}\, \vert_{\Gamma_1^-} = - \Delta u, \\
& \bm{u} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_3} \vert_{\Gamma_1^+}- \bm{u} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_3}\vert_{\Gamma_1^-} =  0,  \\
& \bm{u}\,\vert_{\Gamma_3^-}- \bm{u}\,\vert_{\Gamma_3^+} = \bm{0}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

Finally, for the shear test, the BC for displacements are
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.10}
\begin{split}
& \bm{u} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_1}\,\vert_{\Gamma_3^+}- \bm{u} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_1} \,\vert_{\Gamma_3^-} =\Delta u,\\
& \bm{u} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_3}\,\vert_{\Gamma_3^+}- \bm{u} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_3}\,\vert_{\Gamma_3^-} = 0, \\
& \bm{u}\,\vert_{\Gamma_1+}- \bm{u}\,\vert_{\Gamma_1^-} =\bm{0}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

For all relaxation tests, the respective BC for pressure, tractions and fluid flux relative to the solid are
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.11}
\begin{split}
& p\vert_{\Gamma_k^+}-p\vert_{\Gamma_k^-} =0, \\
& \left(\bm{\sigma}\cdot \bm{\hat n} \right)\, \vert_{\Gamma_k^+}-\left(\bm{\sigma}\cdot \bm{\hat n} \right)\, \vert_{\Gamma_k^-} = \bm{0},\\
&\left( \frac{\kappa}{\eta} \nabla p \cdot \bm{\hat n} \right) \, \vert_{\Gamma_k^+} -\left( \frac{\kappa}{\eta} \nabla p \cdot \bm{\hat n} \right) \, \vert_{\Gamma_k^-} = 0,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where the subscript $k$ in $\Gamma_k^-$ and $\Gamma_k^+$ takes the value of 1 or 3 at a time to denote opposite boundaries.

\subsubsection{Equivalent viscoelastic moduli}
In this subsection, we detail the steps to obtain the equivalent viscoelastic moduli from the three oscillatory relaxation tests. The first step consists in computing the average of the  stress and strain components. However, this computation is only performed over the sub-domain of interest $\Omega_p \subset \Omega_e$. This is followed by an estimation of the equivalent viscoelastic moduli that best fit these values. In the following, we outline this procedure.

For every oscillatory test $t$ with $t = \{1,2,3\}$, we calculate, over the sub-domain $\Omega_p$, the average  of the stress components $\langle \sigma_{ij}^t \rangle_{\Omega_p}$ and of the respective strain components $\langle \varepsilon_{ij}^t \rangle_{\Omega_p}$, with $i=\{1,3\}$ and $j=\{1,3\}$. The corresponding average quantities $\langle \Box \rangle_{\Omega_p}$ are computed as

In Voigt's notation, the average strain and stress is related by the homogenized stiffness matrix $\bm{C} = \bm{C} (\omega) $. We remark that the elements of $\bm{C}$  are  complex-valued and frequency-dependent stiffness coefficients and we write this strain--stress relationship in frequency domain as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.13}
 \begin{split}
 \begin{pmatrix}
 \langle \sigma_{11}^t\rangle \\
 \langle \sigma_{33}^t\rangle \\
  \langle\sigma_{13}^t\rangle \\
 \end{pmatrix}
 =
   \begin{pmatrix}
  C_{11} & C_{13} & C_{15} \\
  C_{13} & C_{33} & C_{35} \\
  C_{15} & C_{35} & C_{55}\\
 \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
 \langle\varepsilon_{11}^t \rangle \\
 \langle \varepsilon_{33}^t \rangle \\
 2\, \langle \varepsilon_{13}^t \rangle \\
 \end{pmatrix}.
 \end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
Using this constitutive equation, a least squares minimization procedure is performed to find the best-fitting values of the viscoelastic moduli \cite{Rubino2016}. The obtained homogenized moduli are used for reflectivity calculations as further explained in Appendix B.

\section{Results}

We assess the proposed homogenization methodology using a thin layer model of 1.2 m  of thickness that consists of a stack of two poroelastic  sandstones beds B1 and B2, similar to the model presented in Figure \ref{fig.1}a. We consider that the upper bed B1 is CO$_2$-saturated whilst the lower one B2 is water-saturated. This thin layer is embedded 
in the half-spaces $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$ deemed impermeable for the seismic frequencies (Figure \ref{fig.1}a and Table \ref{table.1}). To test the proposed method, we follow the procedure described below: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We first calculate the equivalent frequency-dependent moduli applying the proposed homogenization methodoloy. To this end, we use a sample $\Omega_e$ similar to that shown in Figure \ref{fig.1}b that includes part of the half-spaces $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$. 
   
    \item Then, using these equivalent medium, we calculate PP reflectivities  at the its interface with the upper half-space $\Lambda_1$. Appendix B details the methodology for the PP reflectivity calculation.
    
    \item  Finally, to evaluate the accuracy of these reflectivity computations, we compare them against the results obtained using the model with the poroelastic thin layer. Appendix A details the corresponding  PP reflectivity calculations.
\end{enumerate}

The rock and fluid physical properties used in the calculations are shown in Tables \ref{table.1} and \ref{table.2}, respectively. The rock properties of the thin layer beds B1 and B2 emulate those of the Utsira sand \cite<e.g.,>{Rubino2011, Boait2012}, while the rock properties of the background resemble those of a shale caprock \cite<e.g.,>{Rorheim2021}.
We remark that, for the homogenization procedure the background is treated as a poroelastic medium. However, its low permeability of $10^{-9}$ D 
ensures that it behaves as impermeable for the seismic frequency range \cite{Barbosa2016}. We refer the reader to the Discussion section where we verify this point. Nevertheless, for reflectivity calculations, the background is treated as an elastic medium (Appendices A and B).
On the other hand, to test whether the proposed homogenization method is independent of the size of the sampled background, we consider samples with background thicknesses equal to 0.12 m, 0.24 m and 0.48 m, respectively.

As stated in the methodology section, the poroelastic-to-viscoelastic equivalence is valid for frequencies that are below Biot's characteristic frequency (Equation \eqref{Eq.1}). For the upper and lower sand beds, these are 6.25 KHz and 8.06 KHz, respectively, and, thus, they are above the frequency range of interest for seismic studies. Indeed, the maximum frequency we consider for the current study is 1 KHz. 
In the following we present the results of the homogenization and reflectivity calculations.
\begin{figure}[!ht]

        \includegraphics[width=110mm, height=80mm]{Figure2.eps}

The moduli are obtained using three different samples $\Omega_e$ (Figure \ref{fig.1}) that consider background thicknesses bg equal to 0.12 m, 0.24 m and 0.48 m, respectively.}
\label{fig.2}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig.2} shows plots of the real part of the non-zero equivalent moduli as a function of frequency obtained using samples that consider background thicknesses bg equal to 0.12 m. 0.24 m and 0.48 m, respectively. The results show that the estimated moduli are independent of the thickness of the sampled background, which implies that the only influence of the background is to affect the BC at the respective thin layer boundaries. 
On the other hand, we observe the homogenized medium is
characterized by vertical transverse isotropy (VTI) that results from the horizontal bedding of the two sandstone units that constitute the poroelastic thin layer. Therefore, the elements $C_{15}$ and $C_{35}$ of its stiffness matrix are zero. Notice as well that $\Re(C_{55})$  (Figure \ref{fig.2}d) is not frequency-dependent. This is because the shear relaxation oscillatory test, which is the analogous to a normal-incident S-wave, generates shear strains and stresses components  parallel to the bedding planes of the thin layer. However, such shear components cannot induce fluid pressure gradients for FPD to take place. Moreover, this element reads $C_{55} = \langle \sigma_{13}\rangle\,/(\,2\, \langle \varepsilon_{13} \rangle\,)$ and it can be shown that this is equivalent to $C_{55}  =\left( \sum_i f_i/\mu_i \right)^{-1}$, where $f_i$ is the height fraction of the $i$th layer and $\mu_i$ is the corresponding shear modulus \cite{Backus1962, Salamon1968}. This value is 0.93 GPa for our example. The moduli  $C_{11}$, $C_{13}$ and $C_{33}$ are affected by FPD effects and therefore present a frequency dependent behavior. Specifically, the pressure gradient for FPD is controlled by the water-saturated region due to the lower compressibility compared to the CO$_2$-saturated counterpart. As a consequence, the deformation induced by the compressional relaxation oscillatory tests creates higher pressure in the water-saturated region that equilibrates when water diffuses into the CO$_2$-saturated pores of the adjacent sandstone bed. Similarly, the transition frequency of these moduli is controlled by the viscosity of water and thickness of the corresponding bed. Using Equations \eqref{Eq.3} and \eqref{Eq.5}, we find that this transition frequency is approximately 11.8 Hz.

(b) Percentage errors of the absolute values of the PP reflection coefficients as a function of frequency calculated for the model using the homogenized medium.}

\end{figure}

Next, we present the reflectivity results using the homogenized medium as well as a comparison against the results obtained using the poroelastic thin layer. 
Figure \ref{fig.3}a shows the absolute value of the PP reflection coefficients with respect to frequency for three different angles of incidence calculated for the poroelastic thin layer model consisting of two sand beds that is embedded in elastic half-spaces and for the analogous model where the poroelastic thin layer is replaced by its corresponding homogenized medium.  
Figure \ref{fig.3}b shows the percentage errors of the absolute value of the PP reflection coefficients as a function of frequency of the model using the homogenized medium for the same angles of incidence used in Figure \ref{fig.3}a. 
Here, we remark that for the model using the homogenized medium, reverberations in the reflection coefficients are expected to appear at a frequency close to 325 Hz for a normal incident angle if we consider that the first resonance occurs when the predominant wavelength is  equal to four times the thickness of the thin layer. Thus, for frequencies equal or higher than the resonance frequency, different behaviors in the reflectivities from both models are expected. Then, for frequencies below 325 Hz, results show that the PP reflection coefficients obtained using the homogenized medium reproduce, with errors below 3 \% those obtained using the poroelastic thin model.

%Discussion

\section{Discussion}
%We have proposed a method to homogenize porous thin layers with non-periodic heterogeneities. 
We have shown that considering a portion of the background in the sample 
permits to incorporate naturally the BC at the interface between the background and the thin layer in the homogenization procedure. In the following, we investigate the impact that substituting the background by different BC has on the estimated moduli. To this end, we test samples that disregard the background and, instead, incorporate the following BC on their pertinent boundaries: fully periodic BC and  no-flow with periodic BC for displacements and tractions. Finally, we discuss some limitations of the proposed homogenization methodology, such as those associated with permeable backgrounds.

\subsection{Testing samples that disregard the background}
We substitute the presence of the background by different BC to test their effect on the estimated moduli. 
To this end,
we take samples $\Omega_p$ that consists only of a representative section of the poroelastic thin layer of the model described in the Results section.
This is $\Omega_p = \Omega_e  \setminus \Omega_b $ (Figure \ref{fig.1}b). Then, we impose the fully periodic and the no-flow with periodic BC for displacements and tractions on the pertinent boundaries for each test, respectively. We detail the corresponding findings in the next sub-subsections.

\subsubsection{Fully periodic BC}
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
        \includegraphics[width= 120mm, height=80mm]{Figure4.eps}
\caption{Real part of the non-zero equivalent moduli as a function of frequency obtained after homogenizing the poroelastic thin layer considered in the Results section using samples $\Omega_e$ and $\Omega_p$, respectively. Sample $\Omega_e$ considers a background thickness bg = 0.24 m, while sample $\Omega_p$ disregards it (bg = 0 m) and, instead, incorporates fully periodic BC on the pertinent boundaries. }
\label{fig.4}
\end{figure}

We homogenize the sample $\Omega_p$ applying the procedure described in the Methodology section, but, in this case, the described equations are applied only  over $\Omega_p$ and on its boundaries, respectively. 
This homogenization procedure is equivalent to consider the sample $\Omega_p$ as periodic \cite{Favino2020}. 
Figure \ref{fig.4} shows the real part of the non-zero equivalent moduli as a function of frequency obtained using the sample $\Omega_p$. For comparison we also have included the previously estimated moduli obtained using the sample $\Omega_e$  that includes part of the background as detailed in the previous section. Results show  a visible difference between the two sets of curves corresponding to $\Re(C_{11})$, $\Re(C_{13})$ and $\Re(C_{33})$, with a maximum difference of around 0.4 GPa. Furthermore, it is also evident the higher transition frequency for the moduli obtained using the sample $\Omega_p$. These discrepancies evidence the impact of the different BC incorporated in the homogenization procedures. For the proposed method, the presence of the impermeable background in the sample induces a no-flow condition and a continuity  of displacement and tractions at the pertinent boundaries with the thin layer. In contrast, the  homogenization procedure that disregards the background in the sample, imposes periodicity of these variables on analogous boundaries. 
On the other hand, as previously detailed, $C_{55}$ is not frequency dependent because it is unaffected by the fluid effects and its closed form computation yields a value of 0.93 Gpa that, in this case, both homogenization procedures reproduce.

\subsubsection{No-flow and periodic BC for displacements and tractions} 

In the previous sub-subsection, we have stated that the background induces at the interfaces with the thin poroelastic layer a no-flow condition that results from its impermeable character and a continuity of displacement and tractions. Here, we investigate the extent to which such no-flow condition influences the estimation of the equivalent moduli. To this end, we  take a sample $\Omega_p$ of the thin layer model used in the Results section, which disregards the background. Then, to incorporate in the homogenization procedure the no-flow condition imposed by the background, we formulate such BC on the relevant boundaries of the sample $\Omega_p$ as part of the  oscillatory relaxation tests. To achieve this, we replace Equation \ref{Eq.11} by the following one
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.14}
\begin{split}
& \nabla p \cdot \bm{\hat n}  = 0 \quad \text{on}\quad \Gamma_3^+ \, \cup \, \Gamma_3^-,\\
& p\vert_{\Gamma_1^+}-p\vert_{\Gamma_1^-} =0, \\
& \left(\bm{\sigma}\cdot \bm{\hat n} \right)\, \vert_{\Gamma_k^+}-\left(\bm{\sigma}\cdot \bm{\hat n} \right)\, \vert_{\Gamma_k^-} = \bm{0},\\
&\left( \frac{\kappa}{\eta} \nabla p \cdot \bm{\hat n} \right) \, \vert_{\Gamma_1^+} -\left( \frac{\kappa}{\eta} \nabla p \cdot \bm{\hat n} \right) \, \vert_{\Gamma_1^-} = 0.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
The first line of Equation \eqref{Eq.14} formulates the no-flow condition on the top and bottom boundaries of the sample $\Omega_p$. All other steps of the homogenization procedure follows the ones specified by Equations \eqref{Eq.6} to \eqref{Eq.13}, which are applied over $\Omega_p$ and on its boundaries.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
        \includegraphics[width= 120mm, height=80mm]{Figure5.eps}
\caption{Real part of the non-zero equivalent moduli as a function of frequency obtained after homogenizing the thin layer model considered in the Results section using samples $\Omega_e$ and  $\Omega_p$, respectively. Sample $\Omega_e$ considers a background thickness bg = 0.24 m, while sample $\Omega_p$ disregards it, and, instead, applies no-flow BC on the pertinent boundaries of the sample (nf, bg = 0 m) to emulate the impermeable character of the background.}
\label{fig.5}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig.5} compares the real part of the non-zero equivalent moduli obtained with the homogenization procedure that applies the no-flow BC on the pertinent boundaries of a sample $\Omega_p$ against those obtained after applying the proposed method over a sample $\Omega_e$ that includes part of the embedding background. These results show that both procedures yield the same moduli. This further implies that to homogenize a poroelastic thin layer comprised of a stack of homogenous and isotropic beds, it is sufficient to account for the no-flow condition induced by the background on the relevant boundaries of a sample $\Omega_p$. This outcome also suggests that, for this type of poroelastic thin layers, to impose either continuity of displacements and tractions at the the thin layer-background interface on a sample $\Omega_e$ or periodicity of these quantities on analogous boundaries on a sample $\Omega_p$ do not have any impact on the estimation of the equivalent moduli.
This is likely to be a consequence of the uniform stress-strain distribution along the background-thin layer interfaces resulting from the homogeneous character of the beds. Therefore, in the following  we examine the effect that stress-strain concentrations at the background-thin layer interfaces has on the equivalent moduli.

Next, we consider a modified version of the thin layer model used in the Results section as shown in Figure \ref{fig.6} to test whether stress-strain concentrations at the interfaces of a poroelastic thin layer with the embedding background are likely to effect the estimated equivalent moduli. This new model incorporates band-shape inclusions in the CO$_2$-saturated region, where the bands have one of their tips terminating at the upper boundary of the thin layer. These inclusions have harder mechanical properties and a lower permeability than the host sand. Specifically, their properties are $K_m$ = 33.1 GPa,  $\mu$ = 29.2 GPa, $\kappa$ = $10^{-9}$ D, $K_s$ = 37 GPa, $\rho_s$ = 2700 g/kg$^3$ and $\phi$ = 0.05. Fluid properties correspond to those of water as specified in Table \ref{table.2}. We homogenize this poroelastic thin layer applying both the homogenization procedure that formulates the no-flow BC on the pertinent boundaries of a sample $\Omega_p$  and the proposed homogenization procedure that uses a sample $\Omega_e$. (Figure \ref{fig.6}).

However, the upper sand presents band-shape inclusions where the bands have one of their tips terminating at upper boundary of the thin layer. The light blue boxes represent the samples $\Omega_e$ and $\Omega_p$ used for applying the proposed homogenization and the one that imposes a no-flow BC on the relevant boundaries to emulate the impermeability of the background, respectively.}.

The sample $\Omega_e$ considers a background thickness bg = 0.24 m.
The maps are obtained in response to applying the vertical compressional oscillatory test for a frequency of 25.1 HZ.}
\label{fig.8}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig.7} shows the real part of the  equivalent moduli as a function of frequency obtained after applying the two aforementioned homogenization procedures.
The results show that there is some disagreement between the moduli estimations from the different methods.
This is likely related to differences in the regions affected by the stress-strain concentrations. To further investigate this aspect, we compare the corresponding stress and strain maps obtained in response to the vertical compressional relaxation test for a frequency of 25.1 HZ. Figures \ref{fig.8}a and \ref{fig.8}b show maps of the real part of the vertical stress components for the sample $\Omega_e$ that includes background with thickness bg = 0.24 m and for the sample $\Omega_p$, respectively. Similarly, Figures \ref{fig.8}c and \ref{fig.8}d show maps of the real part of the vertical strain components for the same samples  $\Omega_e$ and $\Omega_p$, respectively under the same oscillatory test. Notice that in both cases, the vertical compressional test creates stress-strain concentrations in the vicinity of the tips of the inclusions. However, the regions affected around the upper edges of the inclusions are different for the different samples. For the sample $\Omega_e$, these stress-strain concentrations affect a region in the background in the vicinity of the upper interface with the thin layer (Figures \ref{fig.8}a and \ref{fig.8}c). In contrast, for the sample $\Omega_p$  the corresponding stress-strain concentrations affect a region inside the thin layer section in the vicinity of its bottom boundary as a consequence of the periodic character of the BC for displacements and tractions (Figures \ref{fig.8}b and \ref{fig.8}d). Nonetheless, this effect is unlikely to physically occur. This shows that the homogenization procedure that formulates the no-flow BC on the relevant boundaries of $\Omega_p$ considers an additional region of stress-strain concentration at the bottom boundary of the thin layer section when performing the averaging of these components. Hence, applying the proposed homogenization methodology is likely to reproduce more closely the actual stress-strain concentrations induced at interface with the background. We also note that the induced stress-strain concentrations in the background implies that the considered background thickness should surpass this region to avoid the appearance of non-physical stress-strain concentrations at the bottom of the sample due to the periodic BC. On the other hand, for the reflectivity calculations, we can still assume that the upper half-space behaves as an homogeneous material despite of the region affected by the strain-stress concentrations because this region is in general much smaller than the considered wavelength. 

In this sub-subsection, we have shown that for the homogenization of poroelastic thin layer models consisting of a stack of few homogeneous beds and that are embedded in impermeable background, it is sufficient to impose the no-flow BC on the relevant boundaries of a sample that takes only a representative section of the thin layer. Nevertheless, this is no longer the case for poroelastic thin layer models that consider more complex geometries which can create stress-strain concentrations at the thin layer boundaries. For these latter cases, our results suggest that the proposed homogenization methodology can reproduce more reasonably the expected regions of stress-strain concentrations.

\subsection{Effect of the background permeability}

For this study, we have assumed that the background embedding the poroelastic thin layer is impermeable for the frequencies of interest. This assumption allows representing the background as an elastic medium and, at the same time, confining FPD effects within the poroelastic thin layer.
These features are particularly amenable for finding the corresponding equivalent viscoelastic equivalent capable of reproducing the reflectivity response of the poroelastic thin layer, as it has been shown in the current study. On the other hand, if the background behaves as permeable for the frequencies of interest, it would allow hydraulic communication with the porous thin layer and, consequently, FPD would take place. This further implies that, for reflectivity computations, the background should be treated as a poroelastic medium to account for the dissipated energy due to FPD. In such case, a viscoelastic representation of the porous thin layer, as the one proposed in this study, would be inadequate  because it cannot incorporate  FPD interactions at the interfaces with the background. On the other hand, we have shown that a background with a permeability in the nano ( $10^{-9}$) Darcy range behaves as impermeable for the seismic frequencies. Similarly, the work of \citeA{Barbosa2016} shows the same impermeable behavior for background presenting a permeability in the micro ($10^{-6}$) Darcy range. In this regard, background rocks of interest such as shale and crystalline rocks in their intact state exhibit, in general, permeabilities in the range of nano  to micro  Darcies  \cite<e.g.,>{Mitchell2012, Fisher2017, Wenning2018, Zhao2018}, which, as suggested, can be considered as impermeable for the seismic frequencies. This, of course allows representing the background-porous thin layer by elastic and viscoelastic media, respectively, as shown in this study.

\section{Conclusions}
We have proposed a homogenization approach that naturally incorporates the appropriate boundary conditions to estimate the equivalent moduli of porous thin layers that are embedded in impermeable background and that are composed of a stack of few poroelastic beds with distinct fluid and rock properties.
This is accomplished by first, taking a sample that incorporates a portion of the background and a representative section of the poroelastic thin layer to apply the relaxation oscillatory tests and second, by performing the averaging of stress and strain components only over the thin layer section of interest.
Our results show that the proposed methodology yields equivalent moduli capable to closely reproduce the reflectivity of such thin layers. In contrast, the equivalent moduli obtained under the traditional consideration of periodicity yields inaccurate results. We  have also shown that for the thin layer model considered consisting of beds with homogeneous properties, the same moduli are reproduced when a sample that disregards the background is used but its influence is accounted by imposing a no-flow BC on the relevant boundaries of this sample. However, our study suggests that this is no longer the case for thin layers containing heterogeneities that induce stress-strain concentrations at the interfaces with the background, since disregarding the background in the sample produces regions of stress-strain concentration that do not reflect the physically expected ones. For such cases, our study implies that the proposed homogenization procedure yields more reasonable estimates of the equivalent moduli. This outcome further indicates that the proposed homogenization method can be applied to strongly heterogeneous poroelastic thin layers.
On the other hand, our study also suggests that to ensure the impermeable character
of the background for the frequencies of interest is vital to confine the FPD effects within then thin layer to, in this way, ensure that the background and the poroelastic thin layer can be represented as elastic and viscoelastic media, respectively for reflectivity calculations. In general, it is expected that background rocks with permeabilities in the micro Darcy order and lower behave as impermeable for the seismic frequencies.

\section{PP reflectivity  at an elastic-poroelastic interface}

\subsection{Governing equations}
We consider a model in $\mathbb R^2$ consisting of 
$m$-poroelastic layers  $\Omega_{p1}$,  $\Omega_{p2}$,\dots, $\Omega_{pm}$ that are embedded in elastic half-spaces $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$. Furthermore, we denote as $\Pi_1$  the interface between the upper half-space $\Lambda_1$ and the uppermost poroelastic layer $\Omega_{p1}$ and as $\Pi_{(m+1)}$ the interface between the lowermost poroelastic layer $\Omega_{pm}$ and the lower elastic half-space $\Lambda_2$. To compute the  reflection coefficients, we formulate the corresponding poroelastic and elastic wave equations in the space-frequency domain. To specify the poroelastic wave equation,  we let $\bm{u}^p =\bm{u}^p( \bm{x}, \omega)$ and $\bm{w} =\bm{w}( \bm{x}, \omega)$  be the solid displacement vector and the relative fluid displacement vector, respectively for any position $\bm{x} \in z$ with $z=\{\Omega_{p1},\dots,\Omega_{pm}\}$  and angular frequency $\omega \in I$, with $I =(0,W]$. Moreover, we let $\bm {\sigma}^p$, be the total stress which acts upon the PM. Then, we express the corresponding equation of motion as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a1}
\begin{split}
& -\,\omega^2  \, \rho_b  \, \bm{u}^p -  \,\omega^2 \, \rho_f \, \bm{w}= \nabla . \, \bm{\sigma}^p \quad  \textrm{in} \quad z \times I, \\
& -\,\omega^2  \, \rho_f \, \bm{u}^p - \omega^2 g(\omega) \, \, \bm{w} + i \, \omega \, b(\omega) \, \bm{w} = - \nabla \, p_f \quad  \textrm{in} \quad z \times I.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
The constitutive equations are
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a2}
\begin{split}
& \bm{\sigma}^p = \mu \,  \left( \nabla \,\bm{u}^p + ({\nabla  \bm{u}^p})^T  \right) +  \left( \lambda \, \nabla . \, \bm{u}^p\, + \alpha \,M \, \nabla . \, \bm{w} \right) \bm{I}, \\
&p_f=- \alpha \, M \, \nabla . \, \bm{u}^p - M \, \nabla . \, \bm{w},  \end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $\rho_b$ and $\rho_f$ are the bulk density of the saturated porous medium and the density of the pore fluid, respectively,  $\lambda$ is the undrained Lam√© modulus, and $g(\omega)$ and $b(\omega)$ are the mass coupling and viscous coefficients, respectively. The required material properties are calculated as follows \cite<e.g.,>{Barbosa2016}
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a3}
\begin{split}
& \rho_b =(1-\phi)\rho_s + \phi \rho_f, \\
& \lambda= K_m - \frac{2}{3} \mu + \alpha^2 M, \\
& g(\omega) =  \frac{1}{\omega} \Im \left( \frac{\eta}{\kappa_d(\omega)} \right),\\
& b(\omega) = \Re\left( \frac{\eta}{\kappa_d(\omega)} \right),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $\rho_s$ is the density of the solid grain and $\kappa_d(\omega)$ is the dynamic permeability of the porous rock, which can be expressed as \cite{Johnson1987}
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a4}
    \kappa_d(\omega)=\kappa \left(\sqrt{1 + \frac{4 i \omega}{n_j \omega_B} }+ \frac{i \omega}{\omega_B}   \right) ^{-1}.
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
Here, $\omega_B$ is  Biot's angular characteristic frequency $\omega_B = 2 \pi f_B$, with $f_B$ defined in equation \ref{Eq.1}, and $n_j$ is a pore geometry parameter. According to numerical and experimental studies \cite<e.g.,>{Charlaix1988, Sheng1988, Smeulders1992}, $n_j$ = 8 is a reasonable approximation for most porous media.

To formulate the elastic wave equation, we let $\bm{u}^e=\bm{u}^e (\bm{x},\omega)$ be the displacement vector for any position $\bm{x} \in n$ with $n = \{\Lambda_1,\Lambda_2\}$  and angular frequency $\omega \in I$, with $I =(0,W]$. We also let $\bm{\sigma}^e$ be the stress tensor field acting upon the medium. Then, we express the corresponding equation of motion as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a5}
- \, \rho_b \,\omega^2 \, \bm{u}^e = \nabla . \, \bm{\sigma}^e  \quad  \textrm{in} \quad n \times I.
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
The associated constitutive equation is given by
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a6}
\bm{\sigma}^e = \mu \,  \left( \nabla \, \bm{u}^e + ({\nabla  \bm{u}^e})^T  \right) + \lambda \,  \nabla . \, \bm{u}^e\,\, \bm{I}.
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
 
\subsection{Solution for displacements}
We assume that a P-wave propagates downwards, with wavevector components in $\bm{\hat x_1}$ and  $\bm{\hat x_3}$, and strikes the interface $\Pi_1$.  Then, in the elastic half spaces $n$, with $n =\{\Lambda_1,\Lambda_2\}$, the propagating modes  are P- and S-waves. In the poroelastic layers $z$, with $z=\{\Omega_{p1},\dots,\Omega_{pm}\}$, fast P-, slow P- and S-waves are present.

For a given poroelastic layer $z$, we write the total solid displacement $\bm{u}_z^p$  and relative fluid displacement $\bm{w}_z$ as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a7}
\begin{split}
& \bm{u}_z^{p} =  \sum_r \bm{u}_{z\,r}^p, \\
& \bm{w}_z =  \sum_r \bm{w}_{z\,r},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
with $r=\{D_{P1},U_{P1},D_{P2},U_{P2},D_{S},U_{S}\}$. Here, $D$ and $U$ refer to the downgoing and upgoing waves, respectively, and subscripts $P1$, $P2$, and $S$ refer to fast P-, slow P- and S-waves, respectively,

For a given elastic-half space $n$,  we express the total displacement $\bm{u}_n^e$ as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a8}
\bm{u}_n^{e} =  \sum_j \bm{u}_{n\,j}^e.
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
Here, for $n =\Lambda_1 $,  $j=\{D_P,\,U_P,\,U_S\}$; otherwise, for $n =\Lambda_2 $, $j=\{D_P,\,D_S\}$. Subscripts $P$  and $S$ refer to P- and S-waves, respectively. 

We propose the solution for displacements in the form of scalar and vector potentials. Then, we express the displacements for the elastic half-spaces as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a9}
\begin{aligned}
& \bm{u}_{n\,j_1}^e = \nabla \Phi^e_{n\,j_1},
\end{aligned}
\qquad
\begin{aligned}
& \bm{u}_{n\,j_2}^e = -  \nabla  \times \bm{\Psi}^e_{n\,j_2}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
For $n =\Lambda_1 $,  $j_1 = \{U_P,\,D_P\}$,  while for $n =\Lambda_2 $, $j_1 = \{D_P\}$ and $j_2=j \setminus j_1$ for both cases. Moreover, $\Phi^e_{n\,j_1}$ and $\bm{\Psi}^e_{n\,j_2}$ are the scalar potentials corresponding to solutions for P-waves and the vector potential corresponding to solutions for S-waves, respectively. The potentials can be specified as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a10}
\begin{split}
&  \Phi^e_{n\,j_1} = E_{n\,j_1} \exp \left( i\, \bm{k}_{n\, j_1}\cdot \bm{x} \right), \\
& \bm{\Psi}^e_{n\,j_2} =  E_{n\,j_2} \exp \left( i\, \bm{k}_{n\, j_2} \cdot \bm{x} \right) \bm{\hat {x}_2}, 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $E_{n\,j_1}$ and $E_{n\,j_2}$ are the amplitudes for the escalar and vector potentials, respectively and $\bm{k}_{n \,j_1}$, and $\bm{k}_{n\, j_2}$ are the wavenumber vectors for the P- and S-waves, respectively. The wavenumber vectors can be expressed as $\bm{k}_{n j} = k_{nj} \, \bm{\hat {k}_{nj}}$, where $\bm{\hat {k}_{n\, j}}$ is the unit wavenumber vector and $k_{n\,j}$ is the scalar wavenumber for the corresponding wave $j$. This latter depends only on the properties of the medium and on the wave type, that is, P or S. The scalar wavenumber can be written as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a11}
\begin{split}
& k_{n\,j_1}  = \omega \sqrt{\frac{\rho_n}{\lambda_n + 2 \mu_n}}, \\[10pt]
& k_{n\,j_2}  = \omega \sqrt{\frac{\rho_n}{ \mu_n}}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
%write P and S wavenumber equation%

For the poroelastic layers, we also express the solid and relative fluid displacements in term of potentials
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a12}
\begin{aligned}
& \bm{u}_{z\,r_1}^p = \nabla \Phi^p_{z\,r_1},
\end{aligned}
\qquad
\begin{aligned}
& \bm{u}_{z\,r_2}^p = - \nabla \times \bm{\Psi}^p_{z\,r_2},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
%*************
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a13}
\begin{aligned}
& \bm{w}_{z\,r_1} = \nabla \Theta_{z\,r_1},
\end{aligned}
\qquad
\begin{aligned}
& \bm{w}_{z\,r_2} = -  \nabla \times \bm{T}_{z\,r_2},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where  $r_1 = \{D_{P1},\,U_{P1},\,D_{P2},\,U_{P2}\}$ and $r_2=r\setminus r_1$, 
$\Phi^p_{z\,r_1}$ and $\Theta_{z\,r_1}$ are the scalar potentials corresponding to solutions for P1- and P2-waves for the solid and the relative fluid displacements, respectively. Likewise $\bm{\Psi}^p_{z\,r_2}$ and $ \bm{T}_{z\,r_2}$ are the vector potentials corresponding to solutions for S-waves for the solid and the relative fluid displacements, respectively. The scalar and vector potentials can be further specified as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a14}
\begin{split}
&  \Phi^p_{z\,r_1} = B_{z\,r_1} \exp \left( i\, \bm{k}_{z\, r_1}\cdot \bm{x} \right), \\
& \Theta_{z\,r_1} =  W_{z\,r_1} \exp \left( i\, \bm{k}_{z\, r_1} \cdot \bm{x} \right), 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a15}
\begin{split}
& \bm{ \Psi}^p_{z\,r_2} = B_{z\,r_2} \exp \left( i\, \bm{k}_{z\, r_2}\cdot \bm{x} \right) \bm{\hat {x}_2}, \\
& \bm{T}_{z\,r_2} =  W_{z\,r_2} \exp \left( i\, \bm{k}_{z\, r_2} \cdot \bm{x} \right) \bm{\hat {x}_2}, 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $B_{z\,r1}$ and $W_{z\,r1}$ are the amplitudes of the scalar potentials corresponding to the solid and relative fluid displacements, respectively. Likewise, $B_{z\,r2}$ and $W_{z\,r2}$, are the amplitudes of the vector potentials corresponding to the solid and relative fluid displacements, respectively. Moreover, $\bm{k}_{z\, r_1}$ is the complex wavenumber vector for P1- and P2-waves and $\bm{k}_{z\, r_2}$ is the one for S-waves. Besides,  the  presence of the enclosing elastic half-spaces induces inhomogeneous waves in the poroelastic layers. This is because Snell's law imposes the continuity of the horizontal component of the wavenumber vectors across the different media and the presence of the an elastic media enforces this component to be real. Thus, attenuation can only prevail in the vertical direction. Then, we can specify the complex wavenumber vector as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a16}
\bm{k}_{zr}= \bm{\varkappa}_{zr} - i\, \bm{\alpha}_{zr},
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $\bm{\alpha}_{zr}$ is the attenuation vector which has only a component in $\bm{\hat{x}_3}$ and $\bm{\varkappa}_{zr}$ is the real wavenumber vector. This latter can be expressed as $\bm{\varkappa}_{zr} = \varkappa_{zr} \bm{\hat{\varkappa}}_{zr}$, where $\varkappa_{zr}$ and $\bm{\hat{\varkappa}}_{zr}$  are the  real wavenumber and unit vector, respectively. For a given incidence angle striking at the interface between the upper half-space and the top most poroelastic layer, Snell's law states that the horizontal component of the real wavevector of the traveling waves are equal to that of the incident wave $p_i$. This is $p_i = \bm{k}_{nj} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_1} =\bm{\varkappa}_{zr} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_1} = \varkappa_{zr} \sin(\theta_{zr})$, where $\theta_{zr}$ is the angle of the real wave vector with respect to the vertical. 
We express the missing vertical component of the complex wavenumber vector as follows: $\bm{k}_{zr} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_3}= \varkappa_{zr}\cos (\theta_{zr}) - i\, \alpha_{zr}$, where $\alpha_{zr}$
is the attenuation factor. Following \citeA{Borcherdt1982} we find
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a17}
\begin{split}
& \varkappa_{zr}^2 =p_i^2 + \left(\Re\,[\left( k_{zr}^2 -  p_i^2\right)^{1/2}]\right)^2, \\
& \alpha_{zr}^2 = \left(\Im\,[\left( k_{zr}^2 -  p_i^2\right)^{1/2}]\right)^2, 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $k_{zr}$ is the complex wavenumber of the wave $r$, which depends on the wave type, that is P1, P2 or S, and the associated rock physical properties \cite{Borcherdt1973, Borcherdt1982}. To calculate the corresponding values, we follow the procedure employed by \citeA{Barbosa2016}.

\subsection{PP reflection coefficients}
If we assume that the amplitude of the incident P-wave is one, then the reflection coefficient $R_{PP}$ at the upper half-space is equal to $E_{\Lambda_1\, UP}$ (equation \eqref{Eq.a10}). To solve for the unknown amplitudes, we assemble a set of equations by imposing suitable continuity conditions at the interfaces.
In this regard, we distinguish two types of interfaces: elastic-poroelastic and purely poroelastic ones. At the elastic-poroelastic interfaces $\Pi_q$, with  $q=1$ and $q=m+1$, where $m$ is the number of poroelastic layers,
we impose continuity of solid displacements and tractions and we set to zero the relative fluid displacements \cite{Deresiewicz1963}
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq. a18}
\begin{split}
&  \left. \left(  \bm{u}_n^e -  \bm{u}_z^p \right) \right \rvert_{\Pi_q} = \bm{0} \,, \\
&  \left. \left(  \bm{t}_n^e -  \bm{t}_z^p \right) \right \rvert_{\Pi_q} = \bm{0} \,,\\
& \left.  \bm{w}_z \right \rvert_{\Pi_q} = \bm{0} \,.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
For $q=1$, the corresponding media are $n=\Lambda_1$ and $z=\Omega_{p1}$; for $q=m+1$, they are $n=\Lambda_2$ and $z=\Omega_{pm}$. Moreover, $ \bm{t}_n^e$ and $\bm{t}_z^p$ are the tractions on the $\Pi_q$ interface at the elastic and poroelastic sides, respectively. These tractions are $ \bm{t}_n^e =\bm{ \sigma}_n^e \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_3}$ and $ \bm{t}_z^p = \bm{\sigma}_z^p \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_3}$, respectively.

At the purely poroelastic interfaces $\Pi_q$ with $q=2,\dots,m$, we impose the continuity of solid displacements, relative fluid displacements, tractions, and fluid pressures \cite{Deresiewicz1963}
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.19}
\begin{split}
&  \left. \left( \bm{u}_z^p -  \bm{u}_{(z+1)}^p \right) \right \rvert_{\Pi_q} = \bm{0} \,, \\
&  \left. \left(  \bm{w}_z -  \bm{w}_{(z+1)} \right) \right \rvert_{\Pi_q} = \bm{0} \,, \\
& \left . \left(  \bm{t}_z^p  - \bm{t}_{(z+1)}^p \right) \right \rvert_{\Pi_q}= \bm{0} \,,\\
&  \left. \left(  p_{f\,z} -  p_{f\, (z+1)} \right) \right \rvert_{\Pi_q} = 0 \,,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $z$ = $\Omega_{p(q-1)}$ and ($z+1$) = $\Omega_{pq}$. 
%Review the following ...
To complete the system of equations, we express the amplitudes of the relative fluid displacement in terms of the solid displacement through
 $\gamma_{zr}=W_{zr}/B_{zr}$. This ratio can be  obtained from the properties of the porous medium \cite{Barbosa2016}.


\section{PP reflectivity at an elastic-viscoelastic interface}
\subsection{Governing equations}
We assume a  domain in $\mathbb R^2$ consisting of an anisotropic viscoelastic layer $\Omega_v$  
embedded in the same elastic half-spaces $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$ as in Appendix A. We denote as $\Pi_1$ to the interface between the viscoelastic layer $\Omega_v$ and the upper half-space $\Lambda_1$ and as $\Pi_2$ to the interface between the viscoelastic layer $\Omega_v$ and the lower half-space $\Lambda_2$.
 
To compute the reflection coefficients, we formulate the corresponding viscoelastic and elastic wave equations in the space-frequency domain. To specify the viscoelastic wave equation,  we let $\bm{u}^v =\bm{u}^v( \bm{x}, \omega)$  be the solid displacement vector for any position $\bm{x} \in \Omega_v$  and angular frequency $\omega \in I$, with $I =(0,W]$. Moreover, we let $\bm {\sigma}^v$, be the stress which acts upon the viscoelastic medium. Then, we express the corresponding equation of motion as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.b1}
- \, \rho_b^v \,\omega^2 \, \bm{u}^v = \nabla  \cdot \bm{\sigma}^v \quad  \textrm{in} \quad \Omega_v \times I, 
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $\rho_b^v$ is the bulk density of the viscoelastic medium.
Assuming Voigt's notation, the associated constitutive equation can be written as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.b2}
\setlength{\jot}{10pt}
\begin{split}
 &
 \begin{pmatrix}
 \sigma_{11}^v\\
 \sigma_{33}^v \\
  \sigma_{13}^v\\
 \end{pmatrix}
 =
   \begin{pmatrix}
  {C}_{11} & {C}_{13} & {C}_{15} \\
  {C}_{13} & {C}_{33} & {C}_{35} \\
  {C}_{15} & {C}_{35} & {C}_{55}\\
 \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
  \varepsilon_{11}^v \\
  \varepsilon_{33}^v  \\
 2\,  \varepsilon_{13}^v \\
 \end{pmatrix},\\
 & \text{with} \qquad \varepsilon_{ij}^v =\frac{1}{2} \left(u_{i,j}^v + u_{j,i}^v\right).
 \end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

The equations for the elastic wave and its constitutive relation are those presented in equations \eqref{Eq.a5} and \eqref{Eq.a6}.

\subsection{Solution for displacements}
We assume that an incident P-wave propagates downwards, with wavevector components in $\bm{\hat x_1}$ and  $\bm{\hat x_3}$, and strikes the interface $\Pi_1$. Then, the propagating modes present in the elastic media $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$ are P- and S-waves. In the viscoelastic medium $\Omega_v$ quasi-P (qP)  and quasi-S (qS) body waves are present. 
Then, to find the total displacements in each medium, we sum the displacements produced by the corresponding propagating waves.

For the viscoelastic medium $\Omega_v$, the total displacement $\bm{u}^v$ is
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.b3}
\bm{u}^v=  \sum_r \bm{u}_{r}^v.
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
Here, $r=\{D_{qP},\,U_{qP},\, D_{qS},\,U_{qS}\}$, where subscripts $qP$ and $qS$ refer to $qP$- and $qS$-waves.
For the elastic half-spaces, the corresponding total displacements have been already detailed in equation \eqref{Eq.a8}.

We propose plane wave solutions for the displacements. For the elastic media they take the following form
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.b4}
\bm{u}_{nj}^e = E_{nj}\, \exp (- i \,\bm{k}_{nj} \cdot \bm {x} ) \; \bm{\hat {u}}_{nj}.
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

Here, $n=\{ \Lambda_1,\Lambda_2 \}$. Furthermore, for $n =\Lambda_1 $,  $j=\{D_P,\,U_P,\,U_S\}$; otherwise for $n =\Lambda_2 $, $j=\{D_P,\,D_S\}$. $ E_{nj}$ is the amplitude of the plane wave,  $\bm{k}_{nj}$ is the 
wavenumber vector and its definition is the same as detailed in equations \eqref{Eq.a10} and \eqref{Eq.a11},
$\bm {x}$ is the position vector and $\bm{\hat {u}}_{nj}$ is the wave polarization unit vector that describes the direction of particle displacement. For P-waves, this vector is parallel to the wavenumber vector $\bm{k}_{nj}$ and for S-waves, this vector is perpendicular to it.

For the viscoelastic medium $\Omega_v$, the plane wave solution takes the form
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.b5}
\bm{u}_r^v = V_r\, \exp (- i \,\bm{k}_r \cdot \bm {x} ) \; \bm{\hat {u}}_r, 
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $V_r$ is the amplitude of the plane wave, $\bm{k}_r$ is the complex wavenumber vector and $\bm{\hat {u}}_r$ is the wave polarization unit vector. In viscoelastic media, plane waves are in general inhomogeneous,
meaning that the real wavenumber vector $\bm{\varkappa}_r $  is not parallel to the attenuation vector $\bm{\alpha}_r$.  In a smilar way to equation \eqref{Eq.a16}, the complex wavenumber vector can be expressed as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.b6}
\bm{k}_r= \bm{\varkappa}_r - i\, \bm{\alpha}_r.
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
We can also express the real wavenumber vector as $\bm{\varkappa}_r = {\varkappa}_r \, \bm{\hat{\varkappa}}_r $, where $\bm{\hat{\varkappa}}_r$ and ${\varkappa}_r$ are the real unit vector and  wavenumber, respectively. This latter can be related to the $r$-wave velocity $v_r$ as follows: ${\varkappa}_m = \omega/v_r$.
Furthermore, for the present model, the presence of elastic half-spaces together with Snell's law implies that the horizontal component of the wavenumber vector is real. As a consequence, the attenuation vector $\bm{\alpha}_r$ has only a vertical component. Then, for a given incidence angle at the interface between the upper elastic half-space and the viscoelastic medium, Snell's law stipulates that the horizontal component of the wavevectors of the subsequent of the propagating waves are equal to that of the incident wave $p_i$, that is, $p_i = \bm{\varkappa}_{r} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_1} = \bm{k}_{nj} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_1}$.

On the other hand,  the missing vertical component  $k_3=\bm{k}_r\cdot \bm{\hat{x}_3}$ of the wavevector $\bm{k}_r$ and the corresponding polarization vector $\bm{\hat{u}}$ of waves propagating in the viscoelastic medium can be found by solving the equation that arises after substituting equations \eqref{Eq.b2} and \eqref{Eq.b5} into \eqref{Eq.b1}. Here, without loss of generality, we assume that the amplitude $V_r$ is equal to 1. We also drop the subscript $r$. Then, the equation to solve is
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.b7}
(\bm{\Gamma} - \rho_b^v \, \omega^2 \,\bm{I}) \,\bm{\hat{u}} = \bm{0},
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.b8}
\begin{split}
&\bm{\Gamma}=\bm{L}\,\bm{C}\,\bm{L}^T, \qquad  \text{with}  \\
&\bm{L}=\begin{pmatrix}  p_i & 0 & k_3\\ 0 & k_3 & p_i \end{pmatrix},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $\bm{C}$ is the stifness matrix as given by equation \eqref{Eq.b2}. Equation \eqref{Eq.b7} have solutions if $\bm{\det}(\bm{\Gamma} - \rho_b \, \omega^2 \,\bm{I}) = 0 $. This leads to a fourth-order equation in $k_3$, with solutions corresponding to vertical components of upgoing and downgoing qP- and qS-waves. After this, the corresponding unit polarization vectors $\bm{\hat{u}}$ can be found from equation \eqref{Eq.b7}. However, in anisotropic viscoelastic media, the direction of the real wavenumber vector  does not necessarily coincide with the direction of the average energy-flux vector $\bm{S}$ or ray path. Then, to select unequivocally the solutions for upgoing and downgoing waves, the  direction of the average energy-flux should be established for the corresponding wavenumber vectors. This average energy-flux vector $\bm{S}$ is the real part of the complex energy-flux vector $\bm{P}$, that is, $\bm{S} = \Re\,(\bm{P})$ \cite{Carcione1993, Cerveny2006}. The components of $\bm{P}$  can be calculated as \cite{carcione2007wave}
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.b9}
P_i = -\frac{1}{2} \omega \, C_{ijkl}\, k_l\,\hat{u}_k \,\hat{u}_i^*.
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
Here, indices take values of 1 and 3, and $\left(\cdot\right)^*$ denotes complex conjugate.
Furthermore, $C_{ijkl}$ are the components of the stiffness tensor. The conversion of the indices of the sitffness tensor from tensorial to  Voigt notation is as follows:  pair of indices  $ij$ or $kl$ with values $11$, $13$, $31$ and $33$ convert to a single indices $1$, $5$, $5$ and $3$, respectively. For instance, $C_{3113}$ in tensorial notation is equivalent to $C_{55}$ in Voigt notation.

\subsection{PP Reflection coefficients}
As in in Appendix A, we assume that the amplitude of the incident P-wave is one and, hence, the reflection coefficient $R_{PP}$ at the upper half-space is then equal to $E_{\Lambda_1\, UP}$ (equation \eqref{Eq.b4}). To solve for the unknown amplitudes, we assemble a set of equations by imposing continuity of displacements and tractions at the elastic-viscoelastic interfaces $\Pi_q$ with $q=1,2$
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.b10}
\begin{split}
&  \left. \left(  \bm{u}_n^e -  \bm{u}^v \right) \right \rvert_{\Pi_q} = \bm{0} \,, \\
&  \left. \left( \bm{t}_n^e  - \bm{t}^v  \right) \right \rvert_{\Pi_q} = \bm{0} \,.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
Here, $n$ = $\Lambda_q$, $\bm{t}_n^e$ and $\bm{t}^v$ are the tractions on the elastic and viscoelastic sides of the interface, respectively. Moreover, $\bm{t}^v =\bm{\sigma}^v \cdot \bm{\hat {x}_3} $. The traction $\bm{t}_n^e$ on the elastic side has already been defined in Appendix A.
