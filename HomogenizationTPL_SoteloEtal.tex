\begin{abstract}
Thin layers (TL) of interest can present an important mechanical contrast with the embedding background which is suitable for seismic reflectivity experiments. In many cases, such TL consist of heterogeneous structures with more than one saturating fluid, bestowing them a poroelastic character.  
A simple, yet realistic thin poroelastic layer (TPL) model is the one consisting of a few number of  beds with distinct fluid and rock properties. Moreover, an efficient way to study the reflectivity response of such TPL is to employ its homogenized viscoelastic equivalent.
Classical poroelastic-to-viscoelastic homogenization procedures rely on the existence of a periodic heterogeneous structure e.g., an ensemble of beds, that repeats sufficiently to ensure that its effective response is unaffected by external boundary conditions (BC). However the proposed TPL model does not present such periodic structure and, therefore, it is likely that the  BC induced by the embedding background affect the estimation of its effective viscoelastic moduli. Thus, we propose to account for the appropriate BC in the homogenization procedure.  Classical homogenization methodologies perform oscillatory relaxation tests over a sample of the repetitive structure, followed by the averaging of stress and strain components that are then used to estimate the effective moduli. We adapt such procedure to incorporate the BC induced by the embedding background that is considered impermeable. To this end, we apply the oscillatory relaxation tests on a sample that includes part of the background together with a portion of the TPL. Nonetheless, the averaging of stress and strain components is performed only over the TPL portion. To test the proposed method, we consider a TPL model consisting of two sand beds where the top sand is gas-saturated  and the bottom one is water-saturated. After estimating its  homogenized moduli, we use them to calculate the corresponding P-wave reflectivities. Then, we compare these results against the ones obtained using the TPL model. We also calculate reflectivities using the homogenized moduli obtained after applying a classical homogenization procedure.
Results show that the moduli obtained using the proposed methodology reproduces closely the reflectivities of the TPL with errors below 4 \%. However, The reflectivity results using  the moduli obtained after applying the traditional procedure shows deviations as large as 60 \%. The proposed implementation of BC allows the homogenization of more realistic TPL models. This methodology can be readily extended to TPL presenting more complex structures.

\section{Introduction}
Quantitative interpretation of seismic reflection data is a valuable tool to characterize rock and fluid properties.
This is particular relevant for the characterization of small-scale geological features such as thin beds. In this regard,
a layer is considered to be thin if the reflections  from the top and bottom interfaces cannot be individually resolved by the predominant wavelength.Such that their compounded effect manifests itself as a single seismic reflection signal  \cite{Widess1973}. This effects occurs when the layer thickness is equal to or smaller than a quarter of the dominant wavelength \cite{Widess1973, Kallweit1982}.
The corresponding threshold is known as the the tuning thickness and is characterized by an initial constructive interference of the reflection signals from the top and bottom interfaces that becomes destructive as the layer thickness decreases \cite{Bakke1998, Hamlyn2014}.
Pertinent applications of reflectivity studies on thin layers are, for instance,  the characterization of gas-bearing beds \cite<e.g.,>{Cichostepski2019, Shakir2022}
as well as the monitoring of carbon sequestration \cite<e.g.,>{Williams2012,Zhang2013}. In general, proposed methodologies to estimate thin layer properties are largely developed in the frequency domain \cite<e.g.,>{Puryear2008,Rubino2009a,Zhang2013, Romdhane2014, Huang2016} and they are mainly applied in a pure elastic framework. This approach is likely to affect the accuracy of the estimated properties since the elastic theory cannot account for fluid interactions in heterogenoues porous rocks.

Conversely, using  a poroelastic framework allows for an accurate physical description of heterogenous porous rocks saturated with different fluids as they are commonly encountered in thin layers of interest. In particular, evidence suggests that heterogenoues porelastic media
exhibit a viscoelastic effective behavior regarding attenuation and velocity dispersion in the seismic frequency range. \cite<e.g.,>{Pride2004, Carcione2006}. This dispersive behavior is the consequence of an energy dissipation phenomenon known as wave-induced fluid flow or WIFF \cite<e.g.,>{Muller2010} that occurs when a passing seismic wave generates pressure gradients between different parts of a poroelastic medium
that equilibrate by fluid flow.
For typical frequencies used in seismic experiments, WIFF occurs predominantly in the mesoscopicscale range \cite<e.g.,>{Pride2004, Muller2010}. This refers to  WIFF taking place  between  heterogeneities that are larger than the prevailing pore size  but smaller than the wavelength \cite<e.g.,>{Norris1993}. In this context, the substitution of a heterogeneous thin layer by its homogenized viscoelastic representation can be deemed as an efficient technique to study its seismic reflectivity response. Indeed, published work
shows the applicability of the poroelastic-to-viscoelastic homogenization approach to seismic reflecition studies of thin layers. For instance, \citeA{Rubino2011} and \citeA{Rubino2011a} employ viscoelastic substitutes to represent thin sand layers with different patchy saturations of CO$_2$ to investigate the corresponding effects on zero-offset seismic reflection data as well as on
the variation of amplitudes for different incident angles. Similarly,
\citeA{He2020} use viscoelastic substitutes of thin fractures layers to investigate their effect on P-wave amplitude variation with respect to incident angles. Moreover, \citeA{Jin2017} use an effective viscoelastic representation to replace a partially gas-saturated thin layer. This model is later used to estimate gas saturation and layer thickness from seismic amplitude variation with the incident angle.

The pioneering work of \citeA{White1975a} and \citeA{White1975} is one of the first to show the effective viscoelastic behavior of simple poroelastic composites saturated with gas and water. Specially, the periodic model of alternating  beds \cite{White1975} has been applied to represent thin layers of interest and to study their reflectivity response. 
In this modeling approach, the thin layer consists of a stack of these alternating beds that are deemed homogeneous and isotropic.
This thin layer representation is convenient for
testing the sensitivity of various poroelastic parameters as it allows the computation of its effective moduli by analytical means \cite<e.g.,>{Carcione2006, Krzikalla2011}. For instance,  \citeA{Quintal2009} and \citeA{Quintal2011a} compare the reflection coefficients at normal incidence of viscoelastic substitutes of thin layer models presenting a periodic structure consisting of  
alternating beds with different rock and fluid properties. Whereas, \citeA{He2020} utilize a particular version of this model to represent a thin layer containing fractures. In this case, they consider that 
the bed representing the fracture is much softer and thinner than the other one. \cite{Brajanovski2005,Kong2013}. In their study, they use viscoelastic substitutes of these fractured thin layers to examine the effect of various  saturating fluids and fracture properties on the variation of seismic amplitude with respect to the angle of incidence. Nonetheless, a general assumption in the homogenization of porous medium containing a deterministic heterogeneous structure, e.g., alternating beds, is  the periodicity of such heterogeneity. In this regard, the periodic structure should repeat a sufficient number of times so that its
effective behavior is, for practical purposes, unaffected by the boundary conditions (BC) induced by the surrounding rock. However, a more realistic and flexible model to depict a thin layer with an internal bedding structure is to consider a few number of beds in the stack with distinct rock and fluid properties. However, in such case, BC induced by the embedding background are likely to affect the estimation of the effective moduli.
% as the entire thickness of 
%the TPL should be considered for homogenization purposes. 
%Boundary effects on the estimation of effective moduli has been widely investigated, for instance, in purely elastic materials. Studies show that applying suitable boundary conditions is an effective technique to estimate effective moduli  in the vecinity of the boundaries.  \cite<e.g.,>{Dumontet1986,Koley2019}.
While, classical homogenization procedures are not readily applicable to this type of thin layer models, the development of suitable procedures has been largely unexplored.
%the homogenization of the proposed TPL representation with a finite number of beds and distinct properties has been largely unexplored. 
%Consequently, the implementation of appropriate BC in a homogenization procedure to find  
%the corresponding effective viscoelastic representation capable of reproducing the reflectivity response of such TPL model has not been widely investigated. 

In this work, we seek to alleviate this problem by proposing a method to homogenized poroelastic thin layers consisting of a non-periodic bedding structure with the overall goal of adequately predicting its reflectivity. Under this scenario, the BC induced by the embedding background is likely to affect the estimation of the corresponding effective moduli. In this study, we assume that this embedding background behaves as an impermeable rock for the frequencies of interest, allowing the entrapment of fluids e.g., natural gas or carbon, within the thin layer. Considering an impermeable background is relevant to represent, for instance, thin permeable sandstone layers intercalated by imprevious shales \cite<e.g.,>{Torres-verdin2012,AbuEl-Ata2019}, as well as to depict an open fracture surrounded by a permeable damage zone, which are embedded in an impermeable background rock \cite<e.g.,>{Caine1996, Mitchell2012}. Then, to find the viscoelastic equivalent of thin layers with a non-periodic bedding structure,
we propose to incorporate the pertinent BC induced by such impermeable embedding background in a numerical homogenization procedure. 
Classical homogenization procedures of poroelastic media with periodic heterogeneities  apply oscillatory relaxation tests to a sample of the repetitive structure. This is followed by the averaging of the stress and the strain components over the sample to estimate the homogenized moduli. We adapt this procedure to incorporate the BC induced by the embedding background. The proposed method proceed as follows,
we  apply the oscillatory relaxation tests to a sample that includes part of the embedding background as well as the entire thickness of the thin layer. However, to obtain the homogenized moduli, the averaging of stress and strain components is performed only over the thin layer thickness. To test the proposed method, we consider a thin layer model consisting of two sand beds where the upper one is gas-saturated  and the bottom one is water-saturated.
After estimating its  homogenized moduli, we use them to calculate the corresponding P-wave reflectivities, which we compare against the exact reflectivities obtained using the poroelastic thin layer model. 
%We also calculate reflectivities using the homogenized media applying a classical homogenization procedure over a TPL sample as shown in Figure \ref{fig.1}b.
%we assume a infinite horizontal TPL model that consists of a finite number of of beds that present distinct rock and fluid properties. As stated, we also assume that the rock surrounding the TPL is impermeable for the frequencies of interest so that it allows the entrapment of fluids e.g., natural gas or carbon, within the TPL (Figure \ref{fig.1}a). Then, we propose to incorporate the no-flow constraint in the homogenization procedure using twp approaches. In the first approach, we take a sample of the TPL and prescribe mathematically the no-flow condition at the pertinent TPL boundaries (Figure \ref{fig.1}b).  considered periodic. Evidently, this latter approach disregards the no-flow condition that the impermeable background prescribes on the TPL. In the methodology section we detail the different approaches to incorporate the no-flow condition in the homogenization of the considered TPL model. Specifically, we present these approaches as modified procedures of the homogenization methodology proposed by \cite{Favino2020}. After this, in the results section, 


\section{Theory and methods}
In this section we detail the proposed homogenization procedure to estimate the effective moduli of an infinite horizontal thin layer embedded in background that is deemed impermeable for the frequencies of interest.  
%We assume that this thin layer-background system is defined in $\mathbb R^2$. 
In more detail, we consider that the thin layer consists of a stack of few distinct beds which are poroelastic, homogeneous and isotropic (Figure \ref{fig.1}a). 
The proposed homogenization procedure is based on the to the classical treatment described in \citeA{Favino2020} but incorporates substantial modifications with regards to
the extent of the sample considered as well as the volume over which strain and stress components are averaged. For the proposed method, the sample includes part of the embedding background and the corresponding section of the thin layer. Then, after applying the oscillatory test, the averaging of stress and strains is performed only over the domain pertaining to the thin layer.
 These novel adaptations allows
incorporating the effect of the BC induced by the embedding background in the estimation of the effective moduli of the thin layer model considered. 
On the other hand, reflectivity computations using the proposed poroelastic thin layer model  and its corresponding effective viscoelastic equivalent are detailed in Appendices A and B, respectively. Before presenting the proposed homogenization procedure,
we detail theoretical aspects regarding the validity of the poroelastic-to-viscoelastic equivalence.

\subsection{Mesoscale fluid pressure diffusion}
WIFF occurs when a seismic wave propagating through a heterogeneous poroelastic medium creates
pressure gradients that equilibrate by fluid flow \cite{Muller2010}.
We focus on WIFF that occurs between mesoscale heterogeneities since this is particularly relevant for seismic applications. Mesoscale heterogeneities refer to those with a characteristic size $L_m$ that are larger than the pore size $L_p$ but smaller than the wavelength $\lambda_w$. Specifically, for thin layers consisting of a stack of beds, the size of the mesoscale heterogeneity is dictated by the thickness of such beds, which must be much smaller than the wavelength.
For sufficiently low frequencies $f$, WIFF is viscosity-dominated and, therefore, controlled by fluid pressure diffusion (FPD). The reference frequency that indicates the transition from viscous-dominated towards inertial-dominated WIFF is Biot's characteristic frequency $f_B$ \cite{Biot1956, Dutta1979}
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.1}
f_B= \frac{1}{2 \pi} \frac{\eta \phi}{ \rho_f \kappa S },
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $\phi$ is the porosity, $\kappa$  the static permeability, $\eta$, the fluid viscosity,  $\rho_f$ the fluid density, and $S$ the tortuosity of the pore space. The aforementioned considerations regarding scales and frequencies can be summarized as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.2}
\begin{split}
 L_p & \ll L_m \ll \lambda_w, \\
f & \ll f_B.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
It can be shown that the fluid pressure diffusion equation governing FPD stems from \citeauthor{Biot1941}'s \citeyear{Biot1941} quasi-static equations \cite{Dutta1979, Chandler1981, Norris1993}. The corresponding diffusion coefficient $D$  together with its characteristic diffusion length $L_d$ can be expressed as \cite{Norris1993}
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.3}
\begin{split}
&D= \frac {\kappa} {\eta} \frac{M H_d}{H},\\
&L_d=\sqrt{\frac{D}{\omega}},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $M$ is Biot‚Äôs fluid storage modulus, $H_d$ and $H$ are the drained and undrained plane-wave moduli, respectively, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency $\omega = 2 \pi f$.
The required rock physical properties are
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.4}
\begin{split}
& H_d = \lambda_d + 2 \mu, \\
& H = H_d + M \alpha ^2, \\
& \lambda_d= K_m - \frac{2}{3} \mu, \\
& \alpha =1-\frac{K_m}{K_s},\\
& M  =\left( \frac{\alpha-\phi}{K_s} +\frac{\phi}{K_f} \right)^{-1},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $\lambda_d$ is the the drained Lam√© modulus, $\mu$ is the shear modulus, $\alpha$ is the Biot-Willis effective stress coefficient, $K_m$, $K_s$, and $K_f$ are the bulk moduli of the drained solid frame, the solid grains, and the pore fluid, respectively.

The characteristic diffusion length $L_d$ together with the size of the heterogeneity $L_m$, e.g., thickness of the beds in the thin layer, determine the relaxed and unrelaxed FPD regimes. The relaxed state occurs at sufficiently low frequencies, for which  $L_d \gg L_m$. In this regime, there is enough time for the pressure between the beds to equilibrate. Conversely, the unrelaxed state occurs at sufficiently high frequencies, for which $L_d \ll L_m$ and, consequently, there is insufficient time for pressure equilibration to take place and, hence, the different beds behave as are hydraulically isolated. A transition zone exists at intermediate frequencies, for which $L_d \approx L_m$.
This zone is associated with attenuation and dispersion of body waves due to viscous dissipation. The maximum dissipation energy is related to a characteristic transition frequency $f_c= \omega_c/2\pi$, which depends on the diffusion coefficient $D$ and the characteristic size of the heterogeneity $L_m$ \cite{Muller2006}
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.5}
\omega_c \propto \frac{D}{(L_m)^2}.
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

The described mesoscopic FPD process produces an effective viscoelastic behavior of the thin layer under consideration. In more detail, the respective frequency-dependent  moduli that describe such a viscoelastic material can be estimated by solving \citeauthor{Biot1941}'s \citeyear{Biot1941} quasi-static equations over a representative sample of the thin layer and then applying volume averaging of the inferred strains and stresses.

\subsection{Proposed homogenization procedure}
We consider a thin layer that consists of a stack of few poroelastic beds, e.g. B1, B2, B3 and B4, that is embedded in the half spaces $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$ which represent impermeable background (Figure \ref{fig.1}a). To find the homogenized viscoelastic moduli of the thin layer, we apply the homogenization procedure described below over a sample $\Omega_e = \Omega_p \,\cup \, \Omega_b$ (Figure\ref{fig.1}b), where $\Omega_p$ denotes a representative section of the thin  layer and where  $\Omega_b =\Omega_{b1}\, \cup \, \Omega_{b2}$ is a portion of the background, with $\Omega_{b1} \subset \Lambda_1$ and $\Omega_{b2} \subset \Lambda_2$, respectively. As already stated, this sampling strategy allows incorporating the boundary effects induced by the presence of the embedding background on the homogenized viscoelastic moduli.


\subsubsection{Governing equations}
We solve Biot's consolidation equations \cite{Biot1941, Biot1962} over a sample  $\Omega_e$ of the thin layer of interest (Figures \ref{fig.1}a and \ref{fig.1}b) for each of the oscillatory relaxation tests specified in equations
\eqref{Eq.8} to \eqref{Eq.11}. We express these equations in the solid displacement - pressure ($\bm{u}-p$) formulation in the frequency domain \cite{Quintal2011,Favino2020},  with $\bm{u} = \bm{u}(\bm{x}, \omega)$ and $p = p(\bm{x},\omega)$, where $\bm{x} \in \Omega$ is the position  and $\omega_e \in F$ is the angular frequency with $F =(0,W]$. 
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.6}
\begin{split}
& - \nabla \cdot \, \bm{\sigma} = \bm{0}  \quad  \textrm{in} \quad \Omega \times F,  \\
& - i \, \alpha \nabla . \, \bm{u} -i \frac{p}{M} + \frac{1}{\omega} \,\nabla \, \cdot \, \left( \frac{\kappa}{\eta} \nabla p\right)  =0 \quad  \textrm{in} \quad \Omega \times F,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $\bm{\sigma}$ is the total stress, $i$ is the imaginary unit.

The constitutive equation relating the total stress $\bm{\sigma}$ to $\bm{u}$ and $p$ is
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.7}
\begin{split}
& \bm{\sigma} =  2\mu \, \bm{\varepsilon} +  \left( \lambda_d \,  \tr( \bm{\varepsilon})\, - \alpha \,p \right) \bm{I}, \qquad \text{with}\\
& \bm{\varepsilon} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \nabla \,\bm{u} + ({\nabla  \bm{u}})^T  \right),
 \end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $\bm{\varepsilon}$ is the strain tensor,
and $\bm{I}$ the identity tensor. 

 
\subsubsection{Oscillatory relaxation tests}
In this subsection we detail the BC for the oscillatory relaxation tests. 
Hereinafter, we assume a Cartesian coordinate system in $\mathbb R^2$ with the associated basis vectors $\bm{\hat x_1}$ and $\bm{\hat x_3}$ parallel to the horizontal and vertical Cartesian axes, respectively. We also
let the sample $\Omega_e$ be a quadrilateral with boundary $\Gamma = \Gamma_1^+ \cup \Gamma_1^- \cup \Gamma_3^+ \cup \Gamma_3^- $, where $\Gamma_1^+ $ and $\Gamma_1^- $ are opposite boundaries with outer normal vectors $\bm{\hat x_1}$ and $ -\bm{\hat x_1}$, respectively. Similarly, $\Gamma_3^+ $ and $\Gamma_3^- $ are opposite boundaries with outer normal vectors $\bm{\hat x_3}$ and $ -\bm{\hat x_3}$ (Figure \ref{fig.1}b). To simplify the notation, we let $ \bm{\hat n}$ be the outer normal vector
of $\Gamma$.

In the following, we define periodic BC for displacements ($\bm{u}$), pressure ($p$), tractions ($\bm{\sigma}\cdot \bm{\hat n} $) and fluid flux relative to the solid ($\frac{\kappa}{\eta} \nabla p \cdot \bm{\hat n}$). We apply three different sets of displacement BC corresponding to the vertical and horizontal compression as well as the shear oscillatory relaxation tests. Here, we let $\Delta u$ be a real displacement difference in the frequency domain.

For the vertical compressional test, the BC for displacements are
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.8}
\begin{split}
&  \bm{u} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_3} \, \vert_{\Gamma_3^-} - \bm{u}\cdot \bm{\hat{x}_3}\, \vert_{\Gamma_3^+} =- \Delta u, \\
&  \bm{u} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_1}\, \vert_{\Gamma_3^-} - \bm{u} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_1} \, \vert_{\Gamma_3^+} = 0, \\
& \bm{u}\,\vert_{\Gamma_1^+} - \bm{u}\,\vert_{\Gamma_1^-} = \bm{0},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

For the horizontal compressional test, the BC for displacements are
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.9}
\begin{split}
& \bm{u} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_1}\, \vert_{\Gamma_1^+}-\bm{u} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_1}\, \vert_{\Gamma_1^-} = - \Delta u, \\
& \bm{u} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_3} \vert_{\Gamma_1^+}- \bm{u} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_3}\vert_{\Gamma_1^-} =  0,  \\
& \bm{u}\,\vert_{\Gamma_3^-}- \bm{u}\,\vert_{\Gamma_3^+} = \bm{0}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

Finally, for the shear test, the BC for displacements are
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.10}
\begin{split}
& \bm{u} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_1}\,\vert_{\Gamma_3^+}- \bm{u} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_1} \,\vert_{\Gamma_3^-} =\Delta u,\\
& \bm{u} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_3}\,\vert_{\Gamma_3^+}- \bm{u} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_3}\,\vert_{\Gamma_3^-} = 0, \\
& \bm{u}\,\vert_{\Gamma_1+}- \bm{u}\,\vert_{\Gamma_1^-} =\bm{0}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

For all relaxation tests, the respective BC for pressure, tractions and fluid flux relative to the solid are
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.11}
\begin{split}
& p\vert_{\Gamma_k^+}-p\vert_{\Gamma_k^-} =0, \\
& \left(\bm{\sigma}\cdot \bm{\hat n} \right)\, \vert_{\Gamma_k^+}-\left(\bm{\sigma}\cdot \bm{\hat n} \right)\, \vert_{\Gamma_k^-} = \bm{0},\\
&\left( \frac{\kappa}{\eta} \nabla p \cdot \bm{\hat n} \right) \, \vert_{\Gamma_k^+} -\left( \frac{\kappa}{\eta} \nabla p \cdot \bm{\hat n} \right) \, \vert_{\Gamma_k^-} = 0.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where the subscript $k$ in $\Gamma_k^-$ and $\Gamma_k^+$ takes the value of 1 or 3 at a time to denote opposite boundaries.

\subsubsection{Homogenized viscoelastic moduli}
In this subsection, we detail the steps to obtain the homogenized viscoelastic moduli from the three oscillatory relaxation tests. The first step consists in computing the average of the  stress and strain components. However, this computation is only performed over the sub-domain of interest $\Omega_p \subset \Omega_e$. This is followed by an estimation of the equivalent viscoelastic moduli that best fit these values. In the following, we outline this procedure.

For every oscillatory test $t$ with $t = \{1,2,3\}$, we calculate, over the sub-domain $\Omega_p$, the average  of the stress components $\langle \sigma_{ij}^t \rangle_{\Omega_p}$ and of the respective strain components $\langle \varepsilon_{ij}^t \rangle_{\Omega_p}$, with $i=\{1,3\}$ and $j=\{1,3\}$. The corresponding average quantities $\langle \Box \rangle_{\Omega_p}$ are computed as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.12}
  \langle \Box \rangle_{\Omega_p} = \frac{1}{\vert \Omega_p \vert} \int_{\Omega_p} \Box \, d\Omega_p, \qquad \text{with} \quad  \vert \Omega_p \vert = \int_{\Omega_p}  d \Omega_p.
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

In Voigt's notation, the average strain and stress is related by the homogenized stiffness matrix $\bm{C} = \bm{C} (\omega) $. We remark that the elements of $\bm{C}$  are  complex-valued and frequency-dependent stiffness coefficients and we write this strain--stress relationship in frequency domain as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.13}
 \begin{split}
 \begin{pmatrix}
 \langle \sigma_{11}^t\rangle \\
 \langle \sigma_{33}^t\rangle \\
  \langle\sigma_{13}^t\rangle \\
 \end{pmatrix}
 =
   \begin{pmatrix}
  C_{11} & C_{13} & C_{15} \\
  C_{13} & C_{33} & C_{35} \\
  C_{15} & C_{35} & C_{55}\\
 \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
 \langle\varepsilon_{11}^t \rangle \\
 \langle \varepsilon_{33}^t \rangle \\
 2\, \langle \varepsilon_{13}^t \rangle \\
 \end{pmatrix}.
 \end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
Using this constitutive equation, a least squares minimization procedure is performed to find the best-fitting values of the viscoelastic moduli \cite{Rubino2016}. The obtained homogenized moduli are used for reflectivity calculations as further explained in Appendix B.

%\subsection{Proposed homogenization procedure}
%For this procedure, we take a sample $\Omega_e = \Omega_b \,\cup\, \Omega$ (Figures \ref{fig.1}a and \ref{fig.1}c) that includes part of the background rock $\Omega_b = \Omega_{b1}\, \cup \, \Omega_{b2} $ and the same TPL subdomain $\Omega$ used for the traditional procedure. After this, we apply the relaxation oscillatory tests on the sample $\Omega_e$. However, to find the effective moduli, we perform the average of stress and strain components only over the domain of interest  $\Omega$. We detail in the following the modifications with respect to the classical homogenization method.
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%\setlength\itemsep{1em}
%\item Governing Equations
%
%We use the same governing equations as expressed by Equations \eqref{Eq.6} and \eqref{Eq.7}. However, now we apply them over the domain $\Omega_e$. Thus, these governing equations are now valid $ \forall \, \bm{x} \in \Omega_e$.
%\\
%
%\item Oscillatory relaxation tests
%
%For this case, we let $\Gamma$ be the boundary of $\Omega_e$ with  $\Gamma = \Gamma_1^+ \,\cup \,\Gamma_1^- \,\cup \,\Gamma_3^+ \, \cup \, \Gamma_3^- $ (Figure \ref{fig.1}c).
%For the oscillatory relaxation tests, we consider the same set of BC: Equations \eqref{Eq.8} to \eqref{Eq.11}. 
%\\
%
%\item Homogenized viscoelastic moduli
%
%For each oscillatory relaxation test, we perform the averaging of stress and strain components as specified by Equation \eqref{Eq.12} over the subdomain of interest $\Omega \,\subset \, \Omega_e$. Finally, we find the viscoelastic moduli of $\Omega$, using the same procedure described in the traditional method. This is, we use the constitutive equation \eqref{Eq.14} and a minimization procedure that best fit the average strain and stress components \cite{Rubino2016}.

We assess the proposed homogenization methodology using a thin layer model of 0.4 m  of thickness that consists of two stack of poroelastic  sandstones beds of equal thickness, e.g., B1 and B2, similar to the model presented in Figure \ref{fig.1}a. We consider that the upper bed B1 is water-saturated whilst the lower one B2 is assumed to be gas saturated. This thin layer is embedded 
in elastic-half spaces $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$, which represent an impermeable background  with rock physical properties emulating a siliciclastic claystone (Figure \ref{fig.1}a and Table \ref{table.1}). To perform the evaluation, we follow the procedure described below: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We first calculate the frequency-dependent moduli applying the proposed homogenization methodoloy. To this end, we use a sample $\Omega_e$ similar to that shown in Figure \ref{fig.1}b that includes part of the half-spaces $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$. 
    %Here, we assume that the sampled half-spaces have the same thickness that is equal to that of the TPL's.
    
    \item Then, using these effective viscoelastic moduli, we calculate PP reflectivities  at the the interface between the upper half-space $\Lambda_1$ and the effective viscoelastic medium. Appendix B details the methodology for the PP reflectivity calculation.
    
    \item  Finally, to evaluate the accuracy of the reflectivity computations obtained using the effective viscoelastic equivalent, we compare them against the exact results obtained using the model with the poroelastic thin layer. Appendix A details the PP reflectivity calculations for a poroelastic medium consisting of a stack of beds that is embedded in elastic half-spaces.
\end{enumerate}

%To compare reflectivities, we calculate the respective percentage errors of the absolute values of PP reflections coefficients $\delta |RPP| \,(\%)$  as follows
%\begin{linenomath*}
%\begin{equation}\label{Eq.15}
%\delta |RPP|\, (\%)= \frac{|\,|RPP|_{HTPL} - |RPP|_{TPL}\,|} {|RPP|_{TPL}} \times 100,
%\end{equation}
%\end{linenomath*}
%where $ |RPP|_{HTPL}$  and $|RPP|_{HTPL}$ are the absolute value of the PP refelction coefficient of the corresponding HTPL and the TPL, respectively.
To perform the homogenizations and reflectivity calculations we use the rock and fluid physical properties presented in Tables \ref{table.1} and \ref{table.2}, respectively. On the other hand,  to test whether the proposed method is independent of the size of the sampled background, we consider samples with background thicknesses that are half, one, and three times the thickness of the thin layer, respectively.

As stated in the methodology section, the poroelastic-to-viscoelastic equivalence is valid for frequencies that are below Biot's characteristic frequency (Equation \eqref{Eq.1}). For the top and bottom sand beds, these are 89.9 KHz and 44.8 KHz, respectively, and, thus, they are well above the frequency range of interest for seismic studies. Indeed, the maximum frequency we consider for the current study is 1 KHz. 
In the following we present the results of the homogenization and reflectivity calculations.

The corresponding curves are labeled EM-bg05, EM-bg1 and EM-bg3, respectively.}

%\label{fig.4}
%\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig.3} shows plots of the real part of the non-zero effective moduli as a function of frequency obtained using samples that consider background thicknesses that are half, one and three times the thickness of the thin layer. The corresponding curves are labeled EM-bg05, EM-bg1 and EM-bg3, respectively. The results show that the estimated moduli are independent of the thickness of the sampled background, which implies that the only influence of the background is to affect the BC at the respective thin layer boundaries. 
On the other hand, we observe the homogenized medium is
characterized by vertical transverse isotropy (VTI) that results from the horizontal bedding of the two sandstones that constitute the thin layer. Therefore, the elements $C_{15}$ and $C_{35}$ of its stiffness matrix are zero. Notice as well that $\Re(C_{55})$  (Figure \ref{fig.3}d) is not frequency-dependent. This is because in VTI media, the shear relaxation oscillatory test, which is the analogous to a normal-incident S-wave, generates shear strains and stresses components  parallel to the bedding plane. However, such shear components are not locally perturbed by the fluid content of the beds since fluids cannot support shear stress. Moreover, this element reads $C_{55} = \langle \sigma_{13}\rangle\,/(\,2\, \langle \varepsilon_{13} \rangle\,)$ and it can be shown that this is equivalent to $C_{55}  =\left( \sum_i f_i/\mu_i \right)^{-1}$, where $f_i$ is the height fraction of the $i$th layer and $\mu_i$ is the corresponding shear modulus \cite{Backus1962, Salamon1968}. This value is 15.3 GPa for our example. The moduli  $C_{11}$, $C_{13}$ and $C_{33}$ are affected by FPD effects and therefore present a frequency dependent behavior. Specifically, the pressure gradient for FPD is controlled by the water-saturated region due to the lower compressibility compared to the gas-saturated counterpart. As a consequence, the deformation induced by the compressinal relaxation oscillatory tests creates  higher pressure increments in this region that equilibrate when the water diffuses into the gas-saturated pores of the adjacent sandstone bed. Similarly, the transition frequency of these moduli is controlled by the viscosity of water and thickness of the corresponding bed. Using Equations \eqref{Eq.3} and \eqref{Eq.5}, we find that this transition frequency is around 50.4 KHz.

%Notice that both homogenization procedures reproduce this value (Figure \ref{fig.3}d). This shows that, given the VTI nature of the TPL, the estimation of this modulus is insensitive to the BC imposed at the TPL-background interface. However, this is not the case for the real part of elements $C_{11}$,  $C_{13}$ and $C_{33}$ where differences between the HTPL-bg and HTPL-p moduli are visible and in average they are around 1 GPa. In this regard, these discrepancies evidence the impact on the moduli estimations of the different BC incorporated in the homogenization procedures. For the proposed procedure, the presence of impermeable background in the sample induces a no-flow condition and a continuity of displacement and tractions at the boundaries of the TPL. In contrast, the traditional method imposes periodicity of these variables on analogous boundaries.

These results show that the PP reflection coefficients obtained using the homogenized medium of the poroelastic thin layer reproduce, with acceptable errors, those obtained using the poroelastic thin model. In fact, for frequencies within the seismic range the errors are below 4\%, where maximum errors correspond to an incident angle of 20 degrees. 
%In contrast,
%reflectivity deviations using using the HTPL-p are larger. The errors have a maximum of 60.5\% for an incident angle of 20 degrees and, in average, errors are consistently higher compared to the ones obtained using the HTPL-bg, presenting a maximum of 9.7\%  and 22.7\% for incident angles of 0 and 40 degrees, respectively.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Effect of disregarding the background in the sample}

The corresponding curves labels include the acronym HM and HM-nobg, respectively. b) Percentae errors of the absolute values of the PP reflection coefficients as a function of frequency calculated for the same angles of incidence and homogenized media considered in part (a).}

\end{figure}

We first investigate the impact of considering a sample that disregards the background on the effective moduli estimation of the thin poroelastic layer considered in the previous section. After this, we analyze the effect that using such homogenized medium has on the accuracy of the reflectivity computations in comparison to the exact solutions obtained using the thin poroelastic layer. To this end, we take a sample that consists only of the representative section of the poroelastic thin layer $\Omega_p$ (Figure \ref{fig.1}b) of the thin model to apply the homogenization procedure described in the Methodology section. However, for this case, the governing equations and oscillatory tests are used only over $\Omega_p$. We remark that this homogenization procedure applies periodic BC on the boundaries of $\Omega_p$, which is the same as regarding this sample as periodic.
Figure \ref{fig.4} shows the real part of the non-zero effective moduli as a function of frequency obtained using the sample $\Omega_p$ that disregards the background (curves labeled EM-nobg). For comparison we also have included the previously estimated moduli (curves labeled EM-bg05) obtained using the sample $\Omega_e$  that includes part of the background as detailed in the previous section. Results show that for the real part of the elements $C_{11}$, $C_{13}$ and $C_{13}$ there is a visible difference, that reaches a maximum values of around 1 GPa, between the curves obtained using the sample that disregards the background and the one that considers it (proposed method). In this regard, these discrepancies evidence the impact of the different BC incorporated in the homogenization procedures due to the sampling strategy. For the proposed method, the presence of the impermeable background in the sample induces a no-flow condition and a continuity  of displacement and tractions at the pertinent boundaries of the representative section of the poroelastic thin layer. In contrast, the homogenization procedure that disregards the background in the sample, imposes periodicity of these variables on analogous boundaries. On the other hand, as previously detailed,  $C_{55}$ is not frequency dependent due to the VTI nature of the poroelastic thin layer considered. As previously explained, this moduli is unaffected by fluid effects and its closed form computation yields a value of 15.3 Gpa that, in this case, both homogenization procedures reproduce. This reveals that this modulus is insensitive to the BC imposed at the poroelastic thin layer-background interface.

Next, we compare the reflectivity results. Figure \ref{fig.5}a shows the  absolute values of the PP reflection coefficients as a function of frequency for three different angles of incidence calculated for the poroelastic thin layer embedded in half-spaces (curves beginning with the acronym PTL) and for the analogous models where the poroelastic thin layer is replaced by the corresponding homogenized media obtained with the samples that include and disregard the background, respectively (curves beginning with the acronym HM and HM-nobg, respectively). Figure \ref{fig.5}b shows the percentage errors of the absolute value of PP reflection coefficients as a function of frequency for the same angles of incidence and homogenized media considered in Figure \ref{fig.5}a.  As previously stated, the model that uses the homogenized medium obtained considering part of the background in the sample (proposed method) reproduces with acceptable errors, below 4\%, the reflectivities  within the seismic frequency range of the poroelastic thin layer. In contrast, reflectivity deviations using the homogenized medium obtained disregarding the background in the sample are larger. These errors rise up to a maximum of 60.5\% for an incident angle of 20 degrees and, in average, they are consistently higher compared to the ones obtained using the proposed homogenization method.

\subsection{Analysis of the Boundary conditions induced by the impermeable background} 
In the previous subsection, we have stated that the background induces at the interfaces with the thin poroelastic layer a no-flow condition that results from its impermeable character and a continuity of displacement and tractions. Here, we investigate the extent to which such no-flow condition influences the estimation of the effective moduli. To this end, we  take a sample $\Omega_p$ (Figure \ref{fig.1}b) that consists only of a representative section  of the poroelastic thin layer model considered in this study. Then, to incorporate the no-flow condition imposed by the background, we formulate such BC on the relevant boundaries of the sample $\Omega_p$ as part of the  oscillatory relaxation tests. To achieve this, we replace Equation \ref{Eq.11} by the following one
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.14}
\begin{split}
& \nabla p \cdot \bm{\hat n}  = 0 \quad \text{on}\quad \Gamma_3^+ \, \cup \, \Gamma_3^+,\\
& p\vert_{\Gamma_1^+}-p\vert_{\Gamma_1^-} =0, \\
& \left(\bm{\sigma}\cdot \bm{\hat n} \right)\, \vert_{\Gamma_k^+}-\left(\bm{\sigma}\cdot \bm{\hat n} \right)\, \vert_{\Gamma_k^-} = \bm{0},\\
&\left( \frac{\kappa}{\eta} \nabla p \cdot \bm{\hat n} \right) \, \vert_{\Gamma_1^+} -\left( \frac{\kappa}{\eta} \nabla p \cdot \bm{\hat n} \right) \, \vert_{\Gamma_1^-} = 0.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
The first line of Equation \eqref{Eq.14} formulates the no flow condition on the top and bottom boundaries of the sample $\Omega_p$. Notice that for this homogenization procedure, we still consider periodic BC for displacements. 

Figure \ref{fig.6} compares the real part of the effective moduli obtained with the homogenization procedure that applies the no-flow BC on the pertinent boundaries of a sample  $\Omega_p$ (curves labeled EM-nf) against those obtained after applying the proposed method that uses a sample that includes part of the embedding background(curves labeled EM-bg05). These results show that both procedures yield the same moduli. This further implies that to homogenize a poroelastic thin layer comprised of a stack of homogenous and isotropic beds, it is sufficient to account for the no-flow condition on the relevant boundaries of a sample $\Omega_p$ . This outcome also suggests that, for this type of poroelastic thin layers, BC regarding displacements and tractions are not relevant for the estimation of the corresponding moduli. This is likely to be a consequence of the uniform stress-strain distribution along the background-thin layer interfaces resulting from the homogeneous character of the beds composing such thin layer.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
        \includegraphics[width= 120mm, height=80mm]{cijnf_2sandshale.eps}
\caption{Real part of the non-zero effective moduli as a function of frequency obtained after applying the proposed homogenization method (curves labeled EM-bg05) and a homogenization that uses a sample that disregards the background and applies no-flow BC on the relevant boundaries to emulate the impermeable character of the background (curves labeled EM-nf)}. 
\label{fig.6}
\end{figure}

Next, we test whether stress-strain concentrations at the boundaries of a poroelastic thin layer with the mebedding  background are likely to have an effect on the estimated moduli. To this end, we consider a modified version of the previous thin layer model as shown in Figure \ref{fig.7}. This new model incorporates inclusions with banded shapes that consist of a softer and less permeable material. These inclusions are located in the gas-saturated region, and they have one of their tips terminating at the thin layer upper boundary. They present the following mechanical and hydraulic properties: $K_m$ = 0.4 GPa,  $\mu$ = 0.2 GPa, $\kappa$ = $10^{-8}$ D, $K_s$ = 37 GPa, $\rho_s$ = 2700 g/kg$^3$ and $\phi$ = 0.05. Fluid properties correspond to those of water in Table \ref{table.2}. We homogenize this modified poroelastic thin model  applying both the homogenization procedure that formulates the no-flow BC on the pertinent boundaries of a sample $\Omega_p$ and the proposed homogenization method applied on two samples $\Omega_e$ (Figure\ref{fig.7}).

The light blue boxes represent the samples $\Omega_e$ and $\Omega_p$ used for applying the proposed homogenization and the one that imposes a no-flow BC on its relevant boundaries to emulate the impermeability of the background, respectively.}.

Figure \ref{fig.8} shows the real part of the estimated effective moduli as a function of frequency obtained after applying the two aforementioned homogenization procedures.
The curves labeled EM2-bg05 and EM2-bg3 refer to the moduli obtained using samples $\Omega_e$ that consider background thicknesses that are half and three time the background of the modified thin layer model and the curve labeled EM2-nf refers to the moduli obtained using the homogenization procedure that formulates the no-flow BC on the relevant boundaries of the sample $\Omega_p$. The results show that the moduli obtained using the proposed method are independent of the size of the sampled background. However, there is a visible difference between the moduli obtained applying the homogenization procedure that formulates the no-flow BC on the relevant boundaries of the sample $\Omega_p$ and the proposed homogenization procedure that considers part of the embedding background in the sample. These differences  are likely  related to differences in the regions of stress-strain concentrations. To further investigate this aspect, we compare the corresponding  stress and strain maps obtained after applying the vertical compressional relaxation test for a frequency of 39.8 HZ. Figures \ref{fig.9}a and \ref{fig.9}b show maps of the real part of the vertical stress components obtained on a sample $\Omega_e$ that includes background with half of the thickness of the modified thin layer model and on a sample $\Omega_p
$, respectively. Similarly, Figures
 \ref{fig.9}c and \ref{fig.9}d show maps of the real part of the vertical strain components obtained on the same samples  $\Omega_e$ and $\Omega_p$, respectively under the same oscillatory test. Notice that in both cases, the vertical compressional test creates stress-strain concentrations in the vicinity of the tips of the inclusions. However, the regions affected around the the upper edges of the inclusion are different for the different samples. For the sample $\Omega_e$, this stress-strain concentration affects a region outside the thin layer section that includes a region of the  background in the vicinity of the upper boundary of the thin layer (Figure \ref{fig.9}a). In contrast, for the sample $\Omega_p$  the corresponding stress-strain concentrations affect a region inside the thin layer section in the vicinity of its bottom boundary as a consequence of the periodic character of the BC for displacements and tractions (Figure \ref{fig.9}b). This shows that the homogenization procedure that formulates the no-flow BC on the relevant boundaries of $\Omega_p$ considers an additional region of stress-strain concentration at the bottom boundary of the thin layer section when performing the averaging of these components. Hence, applying the proposed homogenization methodology is likely to reproduce more closely the actual stress-strain concentrations since they affect only the regions in the vicinity of the edges of the inclusions, which in this case, includes a part of the background close to the thin layer upper boundary as shown in Figures \ref{fig.9}a and \ref{fig.9}c. On the other hand, for the reflectivity calculations, we can still assume that the upper half-space behaves as an homogeneous material despite of the region affected by the strain concentrations because this region is in general much smaller than the considered wavelength.

To compare the effect that the estimated moduli have on  reflectivity, we present the corresponding results in Figure \ref{fig.10}. This figure shows the absolute values of PP reflectivities as a function of frequency for several angles of incidence calculated for the model that use the homogenized medium obtained applying the proposed homogenization procedure (curves including the acronym HM2) and for the model that  use the homogenized medium resulting from applying the homogenization procedure that incorporates the no-flow BC on the relevant boundaries of a sample $\Omega_p$ (curves including the acronym HM2-nf). Notice that some discrepancies are visible, specially for an incident angle of 20 degrees. Although there is no analytical solution available for the corresponding poroelastic thin layer model, it is likely that the model using the homogenized medium obtained after applying the proposed homogenization method reproduces more closely the actual reflectivity for the reasons previously argued. %Nonetheless, numerical computations of reflectivities of complex TPL models is a pending subject for future research.

%Although, computations of the TPL2 reflectivities can be performed applying numerical methods, we consider that th
In this section, we have shown that for the homogenization of poroelastic thin layer models consisting of a stack of few homogeneous beds and that are embedding in impermeable background, it is sufficient to impose the no-flow BC on the relevant boundaries of a sample that takes only a representative section of the thin layer to find a good estimation of the corresponding effective viscoelastic moduli. Nevertheless, this is no longer the case for poroelastic thin layer models that consider more complex geometries which can create stress-strain concentrations at the thin layer boundaries. For these latter cases, evidence suggests that the proposed homogenization methodology reproduces more reasonably the expected regions of  stress-strain concentrations and therefore it is likely to yield better estimates of the corresponding effective moduli.poroelastic thin layer models

\section{Conclusions}
We have proposed an homogenization approach that incorporates the appropriate BC to estimate the effective moduli of a layered TPL model that do not present a periodic bedding structure and that is embedded in impermeable background.  The results show that the proposed implementations yields effective moduli capable to closely reproduce the exact reflectivity of layered TPL with errors below 4 \%. In contrast, the effective moduli obtained under the traditional consideration of periodicity renders reflectivity results with larger deviations that rise up to 60 \%. We  have also shown  that, for the studied case of layered TPL with homogenous beds, a no-flow condition is the main constraint imposed  by the impermeable background. However, this is no longer the case for TPL models that include heterogeneities that induce strain concentrations close to the TPL boundaries. For such cases, our study suggests that the proposed homogenization procedure yields better estimates of the moduli. Overall, this implies that the proposed homogenization methodology can be applied to models of TPL presenting more complex arrangements of heterogeneities.

\section{PP reflectivity  at an elastic-poroelastic interface}

\subsection{Governing equations}
We consider a model in $\mathbb R^2$ consisting of 
$m$-poroelastic layers  $\Omega_{p1}$,  $\Omega_{p2}$,\dots, $\Omega_{pm}$ that are embedded in elastic half-spaces $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$. Furthermore, we denote as $\Pi_1$  the interface between the upper half-space $\Lambda_1$ and the uppermost poroelastic layer $\Omega_{p1}$ and as $\Pi_{(m+1)}$ the interface between the lowermost poroelastic layer $\Omega_{pm}$ and the lower elastic half-space $\Lambda_2$. To compute the  reflection coefficients, we formulate the corresponding poroelastic and elastic wave equations in the space-frequency domain. To specify the poroelastic wave equation,  we let $\bm{u}^p =\bm{u}^p( \bm{x}, \omega)$ and $\bm{w} =\bm{w}( \bm{x}, \omega)$  be the solid displacement vector and the relative fluid displacement vector, respectively for any position $\bm{x} \in z$ with $z=\{\Omega_{p1},\dots,\Omega_{pm}\}$  and angular frequency $\omega \in I$, with $I =(0,W]$. Moreover, we let $\bm {\sigma}^p$, be the total stress which acts upon the PM. Then, we express the corresponding equation of motion as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a1}
\begin{split}
& -\,\omega^2  \, \rho_b  \, \bm{u}^p -  \,\omega^2 \, \rho_f \, \bm{w}= \nabla . \, \bm{\sigma}^p \quad  \textrm{in} \quad z \times I, \\
& -\,\omega^2  \, \rho_f \, \bm{u}^p - \omega^2 g(\omega) \, \, \bm{w} + i \, \omega \, b(\omega) \, \bm{w} = - \nabla \, p_f \quad  \textrm{in} \quad z \times I.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
The constitutive equations are
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a2}
\begin{split}
& \bm{\sigma}^p = \mu \,  \left( \nabla \,\bm{u}^p + ({\nabla  \bm{u}^p})^T  \right) +  \left( \lambda \, \nabla . \, \bm{u}^p\, + \alpha \,M \, \nabla . \, \bm{w} \right) \bm{I}, \\
&p_f=- \alpha \, M \, \nabla . \, \bm{u}^p - M \, \nabla . \, \bm{w},  \end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $\rho_b$ and $\rho_f$ are the bulk density of the saturated porous medium and the density of the pore fluid, respectively,  $\lambda$ is the undrained Lam√© modulus, and $g(\omega)$ and $b(\omega)$ are the mass coupling and viscous coefficients, respectively. The required material properties are calculated as follows \cite<e.g.,>{Barbosa2016}
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a3}
\begin{split}
& \rho_b =(1-\phi)\rho_s + \phi \rho_f, \\
& \lambda= K_m - \frac{2}{3} \mu + \alpha^2 M, \\
& g(\omega) =  \frac{1}{\omega} \Im \left( \frac{\eta}{\kappa_d(\omega)} \right),\\
& b(\omega) = \Re\left( \frac{\eta}{\kappa_d(\omega)} \right),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $\rho_s$ is the density of the solid grain and $\kappa_d(\omega)$ is the dynamic permeability of the porous rock, which can be expressed as \cite{Johnson1987}
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a4}
    \kappa_d(\omega)=\kappa \left(\sqrt{1 + \frac{4 i \omega}{n_j \omega_B} }+ \frac{i \omega}{\omega_B}   \right) ^{-1}.
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
Here, $\omega_B$ is  Biot's angular characteristic frequency $\omega_B = 2 \pi f_B$, with $f_B$ as defined in equation \ref{Eq.1} and $n_j$ is a pore geometry parameter. According to numerical and experimental studies \cite<e.g.,>{Charlaix1988, Sheng1988, Smeulders1992}, $n_j$ = 8 is a reasonable approximation for most porous media.

To formulate the elastic wave equation, we let $\bm{u}^e=\bm{u}^e (\bm{x},\omega)$ be the displacement vector for any position $\bm{x} \in n$ with $n = \{\Lambda_1,\Lambda_2\}$  and angular frequency $\omega \in I$, with $I =(0,W]$. We also let $\bm{\sigma}^e$ be the stress tensor field acting upon the medium. Then, we express the corresponding equation of motion as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a5}
- \, \rho_b \,\omega^2 \, \bm{u}^e = \nabla . \, \bm{\sigma}^e  \quad  \textrm{in} \quad n \times I.
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
The associated constitutive equation is given by
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a6}
\bm{\sigma}^e = \mu \,  \left( \nabla \, \bm{u}^e + ({\nabla  \bm{u}^e})^T  \right) + \lambda \,  \nabla . \, \bm{u}^e\,\, \bm{I}.
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
 
\subsection{Solution for displacements}
We assume that a P-wave propagates downwards, with wavevector components in $\bm{\hat x_1}$ and  $\bm{\hat x_3}$, and strikes the interface $\Pi_1$.  Then,  in the elastic half spaces $n$ with $n =\{\Lambda_1,\Lambda_2\}$, the propagating modes  are P- and S-waves. In the poroelastic layers $z$, with $z=\{\Omega_{p1},\dots,\Omega_{pm}\}$, fast P-, slow P- and S-waves are present.

For a given poroelastic layer $z$, we express the total solid displacement $\bm{u}_z^p$  and relative fluid displacement $\bm{w}_z$ as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a7}
\begin{split}
& \bm{u}_z^{p} =  \sum_r \bm{u}_{z\,r}^p, \\
& \bm{w}_z =  \sum_r \bm{w}_{z\,r},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
with $r=\{D_{P1},U_{P1},D_{P2},U_{P2},D_{S},U_{S}\}$. Here, $D$ and $U$ refer to the downgoing and upgoing waves, respectively, and subscripts $P1$, $P2$, and $S$ refer to fast P-, slow P- and S-waves, respectively,

For a given elastic-half space $n$,  we express the total displacement $\bm{u}_n^e$ as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a8}
\bm{u}_n^{e} =  \sum_j \bm{u}_{n\,j}^e.
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
Here, for $n =\Lambda_1 $,  $j=\{D_P,\,U_P,\,U_S\}$; otherwise, for $n =\Lambda_2 $, $j=\{D_P,\,D_S\}$. Subscripts $P$  and $S$ refer to P- and S-waves, respectively. 

We propose the solution for displacements in the form of scalar and vector potentials. Then, we express the displacements for the elastic half-spaces as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a9}
\begin{aligned}
& \bm{u}_{n\,j_1}^e = \nabla \Phi^e_{n\,j_1},
\end{aligned}
\qquad
\begin{aligned}
& \bm{u}_{n\,j_2}^e = -  \nabla  \times \bm{\Psi}^e_{n\,j_2}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
For $n =\Lambda_1 $,  $j_1 = \{U_P,\,D_P\}$,  while for $n =\Lambda_2 $, $j_1 = \{D_P\}$ and $j_2=j \setminus j_1$ for both cases. Moreover, $\Phi^e_{n\,j_1}$ and $\bm{\Psi}^e_{n\,j_2}$ are the scalar potentials corresponding to solutions for P-waves and the vector potential corresponding to solutions for S-waves, respectively. The potentials can be specified as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a10}
\begin{split}
&  \Phi^e_{n\,j_1} = E_{n\,j_1} \exp \left( i\, \bm{k}_{n\, j_1}\cdot \bm{x} \right), \\
& \bm{\Psi}^e_{n\,j_2} =  E_{n\,j_2} \exp \left( i\, \bm{k}_{n\, j_2} \cdot \bm{x} \right) \bm{\hat {x}_2}, 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $E_{n\,j_1}$ and $E_{n\,j_2}$ are the amplitudes for the escalar and vector potentials, respectively and $\bm{k}_{n \,j_1}$ and $\bm{k}_{n\, j_2}$ are the wavenumber vectors for the P- and S-waves, respectively. The wavenumber vectors can be expressed as $\bm{k}_{n j} = k_{nj} \, \bm{\hat {k}_{nj}}$, where $\bm{\hat {k}_{n\, j}}$ is the unit wavenumber vector and $k_{n\,j}$ is the scalar wavenumber for the corresponding wave $j$. This latter depends only on the properties of the medium and on the wave type, that is P or S. The scalar wavenumber can be expressed as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a11}
\begin{split}
& k_{n\,j_1}  = \omega \sqrt{\frac{\rho_n}{\lambda_n + 2 \mu_n}}, \\[10pt]
& k_{n\,j_2}  = \omega \sqrt{\frac{\rho_n}{ \mu_n}}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
%write P and S wavenumber equation%

For the poroelastic layers, we also express the solid and relative fluid displacements in term of potentials
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a12}
\begin{aligned}
& \bm{u}_{z\,r_1}^p = \nabla \Phi^p_{z\,r_1},
\end{aligned}
\qquad
\begin{aligned}
& \bm{u}_{z\,r_2}^p = - \nabla \times \bm{\Psi}^p_{z\,r_2},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
%*************
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a13}
\begin{aligned}
& \bm{w}_{z\,r_1} = \nabla \Theta_{z\,r_1},
\end{aligned}
\qquad
\begin{aligned}
& \bm{w}_{z\,r_2} = -  \nabla \times \bm{T}_{z\,r_2},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where  $r_1 = \{D_{P1},\,U_{P1},\,D_{P2},\,U_{P2}\}$ and $r_2=r\setminus r_1$, 
$\Phi^p_{z\,r_1}$ and $\Theta_{z\,r_1}$ are the scalar potentials corresponding to solutions for P1- and P2-waves for the solid and the relative fluid displacements, respectively. Likewise $\bm{\Psi}^p_{z\,r_2}$ and $ \bm{T}_{z\,r_2}$ are the vector potentials corresponding to solutions for S-waves for the solid and the relative fluid displacements, respectively. The scalar and vector potentials can be further specified as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a14}
\begin{split}
&  \Phi^p_{z\,r_1} = B_{z\,r_1} \exp \left( i\, \bm{k}_{z\, r_1}\cdot \bm{x} \right), \\
& \Theta_{z\,r_1} =  W_{z\,r_1} \exp \left( i\, \bm{k}_{z\, r_1} \cdot \bm{x} \right), 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a15}
\begin{split}
& \bm{ \Psi}^p_{z\,r_2} = B_{z\,r_2} \exp \left( i\, \bm{k}_{z\, r_2}\cdot \bm{x} \right) \bm{\hat {x}_2}, \\
& \bm{T}_{z\,r_2} =  W_{z\,r_2} \exp \left( i\, \bm{k}_{z\, r_2} \cdot \bm{x} \right) \bm{\hat {x}_2}, 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $B_{z\,r1}$ and $W_{z\,r1}$ are the amplitudes of the scalar potentials corresponding to the solid and relative fluid displacements, respectively. Likewise, $B_{z\,r2}$ and $W_{z\,r2}$, are the amplitudes of the vector potentials corresponding to the solid and relative fluid displacements, respectively. Moreover, $\bm{k}_{z\, r_1}$ is the complex wavenumber vector for P1- and P2-waves and $\bm{k}_{z\, r_2}$ is the one for S-waves. Besides,  the  presence of the enclosing elastic half-spaces induces inhomogeneous waves in the poroelastic layers. This is because Snell's law imposes the continuity of the horizontal component of the wavenumber vectors across the different media and the presence of the an elastic media enforces this component to be real. Thus, attenuation can only prevail in the vertical direction. Then, we can specify the complex wavenumber vector as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a16}
\bm{k}_{zr}= \bm{\varkappa}_{zr} - i\, \bm{\alpha}_{zr},
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $\bm{\alpha}_{zr}$ is the attenuation vector which has only a component in $\bm{\hat{x}_3}$ and $\bm{\varkappa}_{zr}$ is the real wavenumber vector. This latter can be expressed as $\bm{\varkappa}_{zr} = \varkappa_{zr} \bm{\hat{\varkappa}}_{zr}$, where $\varkappa_{zr}$ and $\bm{\hat{\varkappa}}_{zr}$  are the  real wavenumber and unit vector, respectively. For a given incidence angle at the upper half-space - poroelastic interface, we have by Snell's law that the horizontal component of the real wavevectors of the subsequent media is equal to that of the incident wave $p_i$. This is $p_i = \bm{k}_{nj} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_1} =\bm{\varkappa}_{zr} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_1} = \varkappa_{zr} \sin(\theta_{zr})$, where $\theta_{zr}$ is the angle of the real wave vector with respect to the vertical. 
We express the missing vertical component of the complex wavenumber vector as follows: $\bm{k}_{zr} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_3}= \varkappa_{zr}\cos (\theta_{zr}) - i\, \alpha_{zr}$, where $\alpha_{zr}$
is the attenuation factor. Following \citeA{Borcherdt1982} we find
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.a17}
\begin{split}
& \varkappa_{zr}^2 =p_i^2 + \left(\Re\,[\left( k_{zr}^2 -  p_i^2\right)^{1/2}]\right)^2, \\
& \alpha_{zr}^2 = \left(\Im\,[\left( k_{zr}^2 -  p_i^2\right)^{1/2}]\right)^2, 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $k_{zr}$ is the complex wavenumber of the wave $r$, which depends on the wave type, that is P1, P2 or S, and the associated rock physical properties \cite{Borcherdt1973, Borcherdt1982}. To calculate the corresponding values, we follow the procedure employed by \citeA{Barbosa2016}.

\subsection{PP reflection coefficients}
If we assume that the amplitude of the incident P-wave is one, then the reflection coefficient $R_{PP}$ at the upper half-space is equal to $E_{\Lambda_1\, UP}$ (equation \eqref{Eq.a10}). To solve for the unknown amplitudes, we assemble a set of equations by imposing suitable continuity conditions at the media interfaces.
In this regard, we distinguish two types of interfaces: elastic-poroelastic and purely poroelastic ones. At the elastic-poroelastic interfaces $\Pi_q$, with  $q=1$ and $q=m+1$, where $m$ is the number of poroelastic layers,
we impose continuity of solid displacements and tractions and we set to zero the relative fluid displacements \cite{Deresiewicz1963}
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq. a18}
\begin{split}
&  \left. \left(  \bm{u}_n^e -  \bm{u}_z^p \right) \right \rvert_{\Pi_q} = \bm{0} \,, \\
&  \left. \left(  \bm{t}_n^e -  \bm{t}_z^p \right) \right \rvert_{\Pi_q} = \bm{0} \,,\\
& \left.  \bm{w}_z \right \rvert_{\Pi_q} = \bm{0} \,.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
For $q=1$, the corresponding media are $n=\Lambda_1$ and $z=\Omega_{p1}$; for $q=m+1$, they are $n=\Lambda_2$ and $z=\Omega_{pm}$. Moreover, $ \bm{t}_n^e$ and $\bm{t}_z^p$ are the tractions on the $\Pi_q$ interface at the elastic and poroelastic sides, respectively. These tractions are $ \bm{t}_n^e =\bm{ \sigma}_n^e \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_3}$ and $ \bm{t}_z^p = \bm{\sigma}_z^p \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_3}$, respectively.

At the purely poroelastic interfaces $\Pi_q$ with $q=2,\dots,m$, we impose the continuity of solid displacements, relative fluid displacements, tractions, and fluid pressures \cite{Deresiewicz1963}
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.19}
\begin{split}
&  \left. \left( \bm{u}_z^p -  \bm{u}_{(z+1)}^p \right) \right \rvert_{\Pi_q} = \bm{0} \,, \\
&  \left. \left(  \bm{w}_z -  \bm{w}_{(z+1)} \right) \right \rvert_{\Pi_q} = \bm{0} \,, \\
& \left . \left(  \bm{t}_z^p  - \bm{t}_{(z+1)}^p \right) \right \rvert_{\Pi_q}= \bm{0} \,,\\
&  \left. \left(  p_{f\,z} -  p_{f\, (z+1)} \right) \right \rvert_{\Pi_q} = 0 \,,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $z$ = $\Omega_{p(q-1)}$ and ($z+1$) = $\Omega_{pq}$. 
%Review the following ...
To complete the system of equations, we express the amplitudes of the relative fluid displacement in terms of the solid displacement through
 $\gamma_{zr}=W_{zr}/B_{zr}$. This ratio can be  obtained from the properties of the porous medium \cite{Barbosa2016}.


\section{PP reflectivity at an elastic-viscoelastic interface}
\subsection{Governing equations}
We assume a  domain in $\mathbb R^2$ consisting of an anisotropic viscoelastic layer $\Omega_v$  
embedded in the same elastic half-spaces $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$ as presented in Appendix A. We denote as $\Pi_1$ to the interface between the viscoelastic layer $\Omega_v$ and the upper half-space $\Lambda_1$ and as $\Pi_2$ to the interface between the viscoelastic layer $\Omega_v$ and the lower half-space $\Lambda_2$.
 
To compute the reflection coefficients, we formulate the corresponding viscoelastic and elastic wave equations in the space-frequency domain. To specify the viscoelastic wave equation,  we let $\bm{u}^v =\bm{u}^v( \bm{x}, \omega)$  be the solid displacement vector for any position $\bm{x} \in \Omega_v$  and angular frequency $\omega \in I$, with $I =(0,W]$. Moreover, we let $\bm {\sigma}^v$, be the stress which acts upon the viscoelastic medium. Then, we express the corresponding equation of motion as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.b1}
- \, \rho_b^v \,\omega^2 \, \bm{u}^v = \nabla  \cdot \bm{\sigma}^v \quad  \textrm{in} \quad \Omega_v \times I, 
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $\rho_b^v$ is the bulk density of the viscoelastic medium.
Assuming Voigt's notation, the associated constitutive equation can be expressed as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.b2}
\setlength{\jot}{10pt}
\begin{split}
 &
 \begin{pmatrix}
 \sigma_{11}^v\\
 \sigma_{33}^v \\
  \sigma_{13}^v\\
 \end{pmatrix}
 =
   \begin{pmatrix}
  {C}_{11} & {C}_{13} & {C}_{15} \\
  {C}_{13} & {C}_{33} & {C}_{35} \\
  {C}_{15} & {C}_{35} & {C}_{55}\\
 \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
  \varepsilon_{11}^v \\
  \varepsilon_{33}^v  \\
 2\,  \varepsilon_{13}^v \\
 \end{pmatrix},\\
 & \text{with} \qquad \varepsilon_{ij}^v =\frac{1}{2} \left(u_{i,j}^v + u_{j,i}^v\right).
 \end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

The equations for the elastic wave and its constitutive relation are those presented in equations \eqref{Eq.a5} and \eqref{Eq.a6}.

\subsection{Solution for displacements}
We assume that an incident P-wave propagates downwards, with wavevector components in $\bm{\hat x_1}$ and  $\bm{\hat x_3}$, and strikes the interface $\Pi_1$. Then, the propagating modes present in the elastic media $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$ are P- and S-waves. In the viscoelastic medium $\Omega_v$ quasi-P- (qP)  and quasi-S- (qS) body waves are present. 
Then, to find the total displacements in each medium, we sum the displacements produced by the corresponding propagating waves.

For the viscoelastic medium $\Omega_v$, the total displacement $\bm{u}^v$ is
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.b3}
\bm{u}^v=  \sum_r \bm{u}_{r}^v.
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
Here  $r=\{D_{qP},\,U_{qP},\, D_{qS},\,U_{qS}\}$, where subscripts $qP$ and $qS$ refer to $qP$- and $qS$-waves.
For the elastic half-spaces, the corresponding total displacements have been already detailed in equation \eqref{Eq.a8}.

We propose plane wave solutions for the displacements. For the elastic media they take the following form
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.b4}
\bm{u}_{nj}^e = E_{nj}\, \exp (- i \,\bm{k}_{nj} \cdot \bm {x} ) \; \bm{\hat {u}}_{nj}.
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

Here, $n=\{ \Lambda_1,\Lambda_2 \}$. Furthermore, for $n =\Lambda_1 $,  $j=\{D_P,\,U_P,\,U_S\}$; otherwise for $n =\Lambda_2 $, $j=\{D_P,\,D_S\}$. $ E_{nj}$ is the amplitude of the plane wave,  $\bm{k}_{nj}$ is the 
wavenumber vector and its definition is the same as detailed in equations \eqref{Eq.a10} and \eqref{Eq.a11},
$\bm {x}$ is the position vector and $\bm{\hat {u}}_{nj}$ is the wave polarization unit vector that describes the direction of particle displacement. For P-waves, this vector is parallel to the wavenumber vector $\bm{k}_{nj}$ and for S-waves, this vector is perpendicular to it.

For the viscoelastic medium $\Omega_v$, the plane wave solution takes the form
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.b5}
\bm{u}_r^v = V_r\, \exp (- i \,\bm{k}_r \cdot \bm {x} ) \; \bm{\hat {u}}_r, 
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $V_r$ is the amplitude of the plane wave, $\bm{k}_r$ is the complex wavenumber vector and $\bm{\hat {u}}_r$ is the wave polarization unit vector. In viscoelastic media, plane waves are in general inhomogeneous,
meaning that, the real wavenumber vector $\bm{\varkappa}_r $  is not parallel to the attenuation vector $\bm{\alpha}_r$.  In a smilar way to equation \eqref{Eq.a16}, the complex wavenumber vector can be expressed as
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.b6}
\bm{k}_r= \bm{\varkappa}_r - i\, \bm{\alpha}_r.
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
We can also express the real wavenumber vector as $\bm{\varkappa}_r = {\varkappa}_r \, \bm{\hat{\varkappa}}_r $, where $\bm{\hat{\varkappa}}_r$ and ${\varkappa}_r$ are the real unit vector and  wavenumber, respectively. This latter can be related to the $r$-wave velocity $v_r$ as follows: ${\varkappa}_m = \omega/v_r$.
Furthermore, for the present model, the presence of elastic half-spaces together with Snell's law implies that the horizontal component of the wavenumber vector is real. As a consequence, the attenuation vector $\bm{\alpha}_r$ has only a vertical component. Then, for a given incidence angle at the upper elastic half-space - viscoelastic interface, Snell's law stipulates that the horizontal component of the wavevectors of the subsequent media is equal to that of the incident wave $p_i$, that is, $p_i = \bm{\varkappa}_{r} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_1} = \bm{k}_{nj} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}_1}$.

On the other hand,  the missing vertical component  $k_3=\bm{k}_r\cdot \bm{\hat{x}_3}$ of the wavevector $\bm{k}_r$ and the corresponding polarization vector $\bm{\hat{u}}$ of waves propagating in the viscoelastic medium can be found by solving the equation that arises after substituting equations \eqref{Eq.b2} and \eqref{Eq.b5} into \eqref{Eq.b1}. Here, without loss of generality, we assume that the amplitude $V_r$ is equal to 1. We also drop the subscript $r$. Then, the equation to solve is
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.b7}
(\bm{\Gamma} - \rho_b^v \, \omega^2 \,\bm{I}) \,\bm{\hat{u}} = \bm{0},
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.b8}
\begin{split}
&\bm{\Gamma}=\bm{L}\,\bm{C}\,\bm{L}^T, \qquad  \text{with}  \\
&\bm{L}=\begin{pmatrix}  p_i & 0 & k_3\\ 0 & k_3 & p_i \end{pmatrix},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $\bm{C}$ is the stifness matrix as given by equation \eqref{Eq.b2}. Equation \eqref{Eq.b7} have solutions if $\bm{\det}(\bm{\Gamma} - \rho_b \, \omega^2 \,\bm{I}) = 0 $. This leads to a fourth-order equation in $k_3$, with solutions corresponding to vertical components of upgoing and downgoing qP- and qS-waves. After this, the corresponding unit polarization vectors $\bm{\hat{u}}$ can be found from equation \eqref{Eq.b7}. However, in anisotropic viscoelastic media, the direction of the real wavenumber vector  does not necessarily coincide with the direction of the average energy-flux vector $\bm{S}$ or ray path. Then, to select unequivocally the solutions for upgoing and downgoing waves, the  direction of the average energy-flux should be established for the corresponding wavenumber vectors. This average energy-flux vector $\bm{S}$ is the real part of the complex energy-flux vector $\bm{P}$, that is, $\bm{S} = \Re\,(\bm{P})$ \cite{Carcione1993, Cerveny2006}. The components of $\bm{P}$  can be calculated as \cite{carcione2007wave}
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.b9}
P_i = -\frac{1}{2} \omega \, C_{ijkl}\, k_l\,\hat{u}_k \,\hat{u}_i^*.
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
Here, indices take values of 1 and 3, and $\left(\cdot\right)^*$ denotes complex conjugate.
Furthermore, $C_{ijkl}$ are the components of the stiffness tensor. The conversion of the indices of the sitffness tensor from tensorial to  Voigt notation is as follows:  pair of indices  $ij$ or $kl$ with values $11$, $13$, $31$ and $33$ convert to a single indices $1$, $5$, $5$ and $3$, respectively. For instance, $C_{3113}$ in tensorial notation is equivalent to $C_{55}$ in Voigt notation.

\subsection{PP Reflection coefficients}
As in the procedure applied in Appendix A, we assume that the amplitude of the incident P-wave is one and, hence, the reflection coefficient $R_{PP}$ at the upper half-space is then equal to $E_{\Lambda_1\, UP}$ (equation \eqref{Eq.b4}). To solve for the unknown amplitudes, we assemble a set of equations by imposing continuity of displacements and tractions at the elastic-viscoelastic interfaces $\Pi_q$ with $q=1,2$
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{Eq.b10}
\begin{split}
&  \left. \left(  \bm{u}_n^e -  \bm{u}^v \right) \right \rvert_{\Pi_q} = \bm{0} \,, \\
&  \left. \left( \bm{t}_n^e  - \bm{t}^v  \right) \right \rvert_{\Pi_q} = \bm{0} \,.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
Here, $n$ = $\Lambda_q$, $\bm{t}_n^e$ and $\bm{t}^v$ are the tractions on the elastic and viscoelastic sides of the interface, respectively. Moreover, $\bm{t}^v =\bm{\sigma}^v \cdot \bm{\hat {x}_3} $. The traction $\bm{t}_n^e$ on the elastic side has already been defined in Appendix A.
