@article{Salamon1968,
abstract = {It is postulated that the rock mass is divided by parallel bedding planes into homogeneous transversely isotropic layers of randomly varying thickness and properties. A. homogeneous, transversely isotropic and continuous medium is defined, the behaviour of which is equivalent, on a large scale, to the behaviour of the rock mass. The stresses and strains in this equivalent medium are volumetric averages, within a representative volume, of the corresponding components in the rock mass. The strain energies in the two media are equal. The five elastic moduli of the new medium are expressed in terms of the thickness and properties of the strata in the rock mass. It is shown, as an example of application, that the stratification increases the relative displacement of the roof and floor of tabular excavations, when the layers are isotropic and their Poisson's ratios are equal.},

@article{Backus1962,
abstract = {A horizontally layered inhomogeneous medium, isotropic or transversely isotropic, is considered, whose properties are constant or nearly so when averaged over some vertical height l'. For waves longer than l' the medium is shown to behave like a homogeneous, or nearly homogeneous, transversely isotropic medium whose density is the average density and whose elastic coefficients are algebraic combinations of averages of algebraic combinations of the elastic coefficients of the original medium. The nearly homogeneous medium is said to be "long-wave equivalent" to the original medium. Conditions on the five elastic coefficients of a homogeneous transversely isotropic medium are derived which are necessary and sufficient for the medium to be "long-wave equivalent" to a horizontally layered isotropic medium. Further conditions are also derived which are necessary and sufficient for the homogeneous medium to be "long-wave equivalent" to a horizontally layered isotropic medium consisting of only two different homogeneous isotropic materials. Except in singular cases, if the latter two-layered medium exists at all, its proportions and elastic coefficients are uniquely determined by the elastic coefficients of the homogeneous transversely isotropic medium. The observed variations in crustal P-wave velocity with depth, obtained from well logs, are shown to be large enough to explain some of the observed crustal anisotropies as due to layering of isotropic material.},
