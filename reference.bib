@article{Barbosa2016,
abstract = {When seismic waves travel through a fluid-saturated porous medium containing a fracture, fluid pressure gradients are induced between the compliant fracture and the stiffer embedding background. The resulting equilibration through fluid pressure diffusion (FPD) produces a frequency dependence of the stiffening effect of the fluid saturating the fracture. As the reflectivity of a fracture is mainly controlled by the stiffness contrast with respect to the background, these frequency-dependent effects are expected to affect the fracture reflectivity. The present work explores the P- and S-wave reflectivity of a fracture modeled as a thin porous layer separating two half-spaces. Assuming planar wave propagation and P-wave incidence, this article analyzes the FPD effects on the reflection coefficients through comparisons with a low-frequency approximation of the underlying poroelastic model and an elastic model based on Gassmann's equations. The results indicate that, while the impact of global flow on fractur...},

@article{Wenzlau2010,
abstract = {Heterogeneous porous media such as hydrocarbon reservoir rocks are effec- tively described as anisotropic viscoelastic solids. They show characteristic velocity dis- persion and attenuation of seismic waves within a broad frequency band, and an expla- nation for this observation is the mechanism of wave-induced pore fluid flow. Various the- oretical models quantify dispersion and attenuation of normal incident compressional waves in finely layered porous media. Similar models of shear wave attenuation are not known, nor do general theories exist to predict wave-induced fluid flow effects in media with a more complex distribution of medium heterogeneities. By using finite-element simula- tions of poroelastic relaxation, the total frequency-dependent complex stiffness tensor can be computed for a porous medium with arbitrary internal heterogeneity. From the stiff- ness tensor, velocity dispersion and frequency-dependent attenuation are derived for com- pressional and shear waves as a function of the angle of incidence. We apply our approach to the case of layered media and to that of an ellipsoidal poroelastic inclusion. In the case of the ellipsoidal inclusion, compressional and shear wave modes show significant attenuation, and the characteristic frequency-dependence of the effect is governed by the spatio-temporal scale of the pore pressure relaxation. In our anisotropic examples, the angle-dependence of the attenuation is stronger than that of the velocity dispersion. It becomes clear that the spatial attenuation patterns show specific characteristics of wave- induced fluid flow, implying that anisotropic attenuation measurements may contribute to the inversion of fluid transport properties in heterogeneous porous media. 1.},

@article{Salamon1968,
abstract = {It is postulated that the rock mass is divided by parallel bedding planes into homogeneous transversely isotropic layers of randomly varying thickness and properties. A. homogeneous, transversely isotropic and continuous medium is defined, the behaviour of which is equivalent, on a large scale, to the behaviour of the rock mass. The stresses and strains in this equivalent medium are volumetric averages, within a representative volume, of the corresponding components in the rock mass. The strain energies in the two media are equal. The five elastic moduli of the new medium are expressed in terms of the thickness and properties of the strata in the rock mass. It is shown, as an example of application, that the stratification increases the relative displacement of the roof and floor of tabular excavations, when the layers are isotropic and their Poisson's ratios are equal.},

@article{Janicke2015,
abstract = {This contribution deals with the numerical homogenization of mesoscopic flow phenomena in fluid-saturated poroelastic media. Under compression, mesoscopic heterogeneities induce pore pressure gradients and consequently pressure diffusion of the pore fluid. Since this process takes place on a scale much smaller than the observable level, the dissipation mechanism is considered as a local phenomenon. The heterogeneous poroelastic medium is substituted by an overall homogeneous Cauchy medium accounting for viscoelastic properties. Applying volume averaging techniques we derive a consistent upscaling procedure based on an appropriate extension of the Hill-Mandel lemma. We introduce various sets of boundary conditions for the poroelastic problem and discuss the relation between size of the SVEm (Statistical Volume Element) and maximum diffusion length. Numerical examples for two- and three-dimensional problems are given.},

@article{Backus1962,
abstract = {A horizontally layered inhomogeneous medium, isotropic or transversely isotropic, is considered, whose properties are constant or nearly so when averaged over some vertical height l'. For waves longer than l' the medium is shown to behave like a homogeneous, or nearly homogeneous, transversely isotropic medium whose density is the average density and whose elastic coefficients are algebraic combinations of averages of algebraic combinations of the elastic coefficients of the original medium. The nearly homogeneous medium is said to be "long-wave equivalent" to the original medium. Conditions on the five elastic coefficients of a homogeneous transversely isotropic medium are derived which are necessary and sufficient for the medium to be "long-wave equivalent" to a horizontally layered isotropic medium. Further conditions are also derived which are necessary and sufficient for the homogeneous medium to be "long-wave equivalent" to a horizontally layered isotropic medium consisting of only two different homogeneous isotropic materials. Except in singular cases, if the latter two-layered medium exists at all, its proportions and elastic coefficients are uniquely determined by the elastic coefficients of the homogeneous transversely isotropic medium. The observed variations in crustal P-wave velocity with depth, obtained from well logs, are shown to be large enough to explain some of the observed crustal anisotropies as due to layering of isotropic material.},

@article{Dutta1979,
abstract = { An exact theory of attenuation and dispersion of seismic waves in porous rocks containing spherical gas pockets (White model) is presented using the coupled equations of motion given by Biot. Assumptions made are (1) the acoustic wavelength is long with respect to the distance between gas pockets and their size, and (2) the gas pockets do not interact. Thus, the present theory essentially is quite similar to that proposed by White (1975), but the problem of the radially oscillating gas pocket is solved in a more rigorous manner by means of Biot's theory (1962). The solid‐fluid coupling is automatically included, and the model is solved as a boundary value problem requiring all radial stresses and displacements to be continuous at the gas‐brine interface. Thus, we do not require any assumed fluid‐pressure discontinuity at the gas‐water contact, such as the one employed by White (1975). We have also presented an analysis of all of the field variables in terms of Biot's type I (the classical compressional) wave and, type II (the diffusion) wave. Our quantitative results are presented in Dutta and Od{\'{e}} (1979, this issue). },

@article{Dutta1979a,
abstract = { In this investigation, Biot's (1962) theory for wave propagation in porous solids is applied to study the velocity and attenuation of compressional seismic waves in partially gas‐saturated porous rocks. The Physical model, proposed by White (1975), is solved rigorously by using Biot's equations which describe the coupled solid‐fluid motion of a porous medium in a systematic way. The quantitative results presented here are based on the theory described in Dutta and Od{\'{e}} (1979, this issue). We removed several of White's questioned approximations and examined their effects on the quantitative results. We studied the variation of the attenuation coefficient with frequency, gas saturation, and size of gas inclusions in an otherwise brine‐filled rock. Anomalously large absorption (as large as 8 dB/cycle) at the exploration seismic frequency band is predicted by this model for young, unconsolidated sandstones. For a given size of the gas pockets and their spacing, the attenuation coefficient (in dB/cycle) increases almost linearly with frequency f to a maximum value and then decreases approximately as 1/√f. A sizable velocity dispersion (of the order of 30 percent) is also predicted by this model. A low gas saturation (4–6 percent) is found to yield high absorption and dispersion. An analysis of all of the field variables (stresses and displacements) is presented in terms of Biot's type I (the classical compressional) wave and type II (the diffusion) wave. It is pointed out that the dissipation of energy in this model is mainly due to the relative fluid flow from the type II wave. From our formulation, many of White's equations can be derived as suitable approximations, and it is shown that the discontinuity in fluid pressure assumed by White at the gas‐water interface is the discontinuity in the fluid pressure contribution by the type II wave. Our quantitative results are in reasonably good agreement with White's (1975) approximate theory. However, the phase velocities computed by White's approximate treatment do not approach the correct zerofrequency limit (Gassmann‐Wood) when compared to the present theory. Most of these disagreements disappear if the corrections to White's theory as suggested by Dutta and Seriff (1979, this issue) are incorporated. },

Such phenomena are known as “mesoscopic effects” and are caused by equilibration of wave-induced fluid pressure gradients. We propose a numerical upscaling procedure to obtain equivalent viscoelastic solids for heterogeneous fluid-saturated rocks. It consists in simulating oscillatory compressibility and shear tests in the space-frequency domain, which enable us to obtain the equivalent complex undrained plane wave and shear moduli of the rock sample.

abstract = {In this work we analyze how patchy distributions of CO2 and brine within sand reservoirs may lead to significant attenuation and velocity dispersion effects, which in turn may have a profound impact on surface seismic data. The ultimate goal of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of these processes within the framework of the seismic monitoring of CO2 sequestration, a key strategy to mitigate global warming. We first carry out a Monte Carlo analysis to study the statistical behavior of attenuation and velocity dispersion of compressional waves traveling through rocks with properties similar to those at the Utsira Sand, Sleipner field, containing quasi-fractal patchy distributions of CO2 and brine. These results show that the mean patch size and CO2 saturation play key roles in the observed wave-induced fluid flow effects. The latter can be remarkably important when CO2 concentrations are low and mean patch sizes are relatively large. To analyze these effects on the corresponding surface seismic data, we perform numerical simulations of wave propagation considering reservoir models and CO2 accumulation patterns similar to the CO2 injection site in the Sleipner field. These numerical experiments suggest that wave-induced fluid flow effects may produce changes in the reservoir's seismic response, modifying significantly the main seismic attributes usually employed in the characterization of these environments. Consequently, the determination of the nature of the fluid distributions as well as the proper modeling of the seismic data constitute important aspects that should not be ignored in the seismic monitoring of CO2 sequestration problems.

@article{He2020,
abstract = {Frequency-dependent amplitude variation with offset offers an effective method for hydrocarbon detections and analysis of fluid flow during production of oil and natural gas within a fractured reservoir. An appropriate representation for the frequency dependency of seismic amplitude variation with offset signatures should incorporate influences of dispersive and attenuating properties of a reservoir and the layered structure for either isotropic or anisotropic dispersion analysis. In this study, we use an equivalent medium permeated with aligned fractures that simulates frequency-dependent anisotropy, which is sensitive to the filled fluid of fractures. The model, where pores and fractures are filled with two different fluids, considers velocity dispersion and attenuation due to mesoscopic wave-induced fluid flow. We have introduced an improved scheme seamlessly linking rock physics modelling and calculations for frequency-dependent reflection coefficients based on the propagator matrix technique. The modelling scheme is performed in the frequency-slowness domain and can properly incorporate effects of both bedded structure of the reservoir and velocity dispersion quantified with frequency-dependent stiffness. Therefore, for a dispersive and attenuated layered model, seismic signatures represent a combined contribution of impedance contrast, layer thickness, anisotropic dispersion of the fractured media and tuning and interference of thin layers, which has been avoided by current conventional methods. Frequency-dependent amplitude variation with offset responses was studied via considering the influences of fracture fills, layer thicknesses and fracture weaknesses for three classes amplitude variation with offset reservoirs. Modelling results show the applicability of the introduced procedure for interpretations of frequency-dependent seismic anomalies associated with both layered structure and velocity dispersion of an equivalent anisotropic medium. The implications indicate that anisotropic velocity dispersion should be incorporated accurately to obtain enhanced amplitude variation with offset interpretations. The presented frequency-dependent amplitude variation with offset modelling procedure offers a useful tool for fracture fluid detections in an anisotropic dispersive reservoir with layered structures.},

abstract = {The finite element method is used to solve Biot's equations of consolidation in the displacement-pressure (u - p) formulation. We compute one-dimensional (1-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) numerical quasi-static creep tests with poroelastic media exhibiting mesoscopic-scale heterogeneities to calculate the complex and frequency-dependent P wave moduli from the modeled stress-strain relations. The P wave modulus is used to calculate the frequency-dependent attenuation (i.e., inverse of quality factor) and phase velocity of the medium. Attenuation and velocity dispersion are due to fluid flow induced by pressure differences between regions of different compressibilities, e.g., regions (or patches) saturated with different fluids (i.e., so-called patchy saturation). Comparison of our numerical results with analytical solutions demonstrates the accuracy and stability of the algorithm for a wide range of frequencies (six orders of magnitude). The algorithm employs variable time stepping and an unstructured mesh which make it efficient and accurate for 2-D simulations in media with heterogeneities of arbitrary geometries (e.g., curved shapes). We further numerically calculate the quality factor and phase velocity for 1-D layered patchy saturated porous media exhibiting random distributions of patch sizes. We show that the numerical results for the random distributions can be approximated using a volume average of White's analytical solution and the proposed averaging method is, therefore, suitable for a fast and transparent prediction of both quality factor and phase velocity. Application of our results to frequency-dependent reflection coefficients of hydrocarbon reservoirs indicates that attenuation due to wave-induced flow can increase the reflection coefficient at low frequencies, as is observed at some reservoirs. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.},

@article{Wang2020,
abstract = {Reservoir prediction is often a primary objective in seismic exploration, especially for deep hydrocarbon detection with its potential for assessing oil and gas resources. Time–frequency analysis has become a successful method for detecting subsurface features and can also be used to identify potential hydrocarbon reservoirs. However, current applications for hydrocarbon detection often occur at low resolution, due to the influence of the windowing functions and lack of prior constraints, thereby affecting gas prediction for thin reservoirs. To rectify this issue, we investigate the use of sparse inverse spectral decomposition (SISD) based on the wavelet transform, which adopts an lp norm to constrain the time–frequency spectra, and thereby provides a more highly concentrated time–frequency representation than conventional spectral decomposition techniques. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the performance of spectral attributes derived from lp-norm constrained SISD and its application to the characterization of deep-marine dolomite reservoirs in southwest China. The gas-bearing zones in target reservoir are predicted well by extracting and analyzing the spectral amplitude responses of different frequency components. The predicted favorable gas-bearing areas are closely related to local structures in the target reservoir, which are also in good agreement with gas-testing results at three well locations and may be used to guide subsequent exploration well development in this region.},

@article{Sotelo2021,
abstract = {Fluid pressure diffusion (FPD) between a fracture and a porous permeable background can increase the normal compliance of the fracture and, thus, its reflectivity. However, many fractured environments of interest are associated with background rocks that can be regarded as largely impermeable for the the typical frequencies employed in seismic surveys. Nonetheless, there is evidence to suggest that the seemingly ubiquitous presence of damaged zones (DZs) associated with fractures may provide the necessary hydraulic communication between fractures and their immediate surroundings for FPD to occur. Here, we assess the pertinence of this phenomenon. To this end, we consider a 1D elastic-poroelastic model, which comprises a poroelastic system consisting of a fracture embedded in adjacent DZ layers. This system is enclosed in an impermeable background represented by two elastic half-spaces. We calculate the frequency-dependent P-wave reflectivity at normal incidence at the background-DZ interface for different permeabilities, thicknesses, and porosities of the DZ. We also evaluate the corresponding normal fracture compliance. Our results show that, when accounting for the presence of a DZ surrounding an individual fracture, FPD effects between these regions induce a higher seismic reflectivity and a higher normal compliance compared to that of a hydraulically isolated fracture. This, in turn, implies that, even in largely impermeable environments, the seismic visibility of fractures can be enhanced through FPD enabled by the presence of DZs.},

Here, we present a compilation of related information to examine a more general validity of this hypothesis for the central URG.

Permeable fractures are intersected to a depth of 5 km at Soultz-sous-For{\^{e}}ts (France) and Basel (Switzerland). The compilation of geologic, hydraulic and thermal data of 15 geothermal wells shows permeability variation among the lithologies with the maximum observed at the top of the hydrothermally altered granite. This higher permeability is likely due to the intense fracture density in the fault core of the fracture zone and the large porous and altered damage zone which allow connection with the reservoir.},

abstract = { ABSTRACTA new multiscale method for wave simulation in 3D heterogeneous poroelastic media is developed. Wave propagation in inhomogeneous media involves many different scales of media. The physical parameters in the real media usually vary greatly within a very small scale. For the direct numerical methods for wave simulation, a refined grid is required in mesh generation to maintain the match between the mesh size and the material variations in the spatial scale. This greatly increases the computational cost and computer memory requirements. The multiscale method can overcome this difficulty due to the scale difference. The basic idea of our multiscale method is to construct computational schemes on two sets of meshes, i.e., coarse grids and fine grids. The finite-volume method is applied on the coarse grids, whereas the multiscale basis functions are computed with the finite-element method by solving a local problem on the fine grids. Moreover, the local problem only needs to be solved once before time stepping. This allows us to use a coarse grid while still capturing the information of the physical property variations in the small scale. Therefore, it has better accuracy than the single-scale method when they use the same coarse grids. The theoretical method and the dispersion analysis are investigated. Numerical computations with the perfectly matched layer boundary conditions are completed for 3D inhomogeneous poroelastic models with randomly distributed small scatterers. The results indicate that our multiscale method can effectively simulate wave propagation in 3D heterogeneous poroelastic media with a significant reduction in computation cost. },

An averaging technique proposed and discussed by for example L{\'{e}}vy, Auriault and Burridge & Keller is used, from which we reformulate the theory by Johnson, Koplik & Dashen. The macroscopic equations then serve to describe the high-frequency behaviour of an oscillating fluid within a porous sample. This behaviour may be characterized by the length parameter $\Lambda$ and by the tortuosity parameter $\alpha$∞. It is shown that $\Lambda$ and $\alpha$∞, which describe an oscillatory flow behaviour, may be evaluated on the basis of steady potential flow theory. Numerical results are then presented for several pore geometries, and for these geometries, the steady-state permeability k0 is computed numerically also. The parameter 8$\alpha$∞ k0/ϕ$\Lambda$2, first introduced by Johnson et al., is then evaluated and appears to be weakly dependent on pore geometry. This implies that for many porous media the dynamic interaction is described by an approximate scaling function. New experimental data, concerning oscillating flows through several porous media, are presented. Within limits of accuracy, these data are in agreement with the approximate scaling function.},

Reflection—refraction laws, physical characteristics of the waves, and the nature of critical angles are examined in detail at welded boundaries and a free surface. General visco-elasticity with no low-loss approximations predicts that contrasts in intrinsic absorption at boundaries give rise to inhomogeneous reflected and refracted waves with elliptical particle motions, velocities and maximum attenuations that vary with frequency and angle of incidence, energy propagation at speeds and directions different from phase propagation, phase propagation that in general is parallel to the boundary for at most one angle of incidence, and reflection—transmission coefficients dependent on energy flow due to wave interaction. None of these physical characteristics are predicted for waves incident on boundaries that respond instantaneously.},

@article{Cerveny2006,
abstract = {We study properties of the energy-flux vector and other related energy quantities of homogeneous and inhomogeneous time-harmonic P and S plane waves, propagating in unbounded viscoelastic anisotropic media, both analytically and numerically. We propose an algorithm for the computation of the energy-flux vector, which can be used for media of unrestricted anisotropy and viscoelasticity, and for arbitrary homogeneous or inhomogeneous plane waves. Basic part of the algorithm is determination of the slowness vector of a homogeneous or inhomogeneous wave, which satisfies certain constraints following from the equation of motion. Approaches for determination of a slowness vector commonly used in viscoelastic isotropic media are usually difficult to use in viscoelastic anisotropic media. Sometimes they may even lead to non-physical solutions. To avoid these problems, we use the so-called mixed specification of the slowness vector, which requires, in a general case, solution of a complex-valued algebraic equation of the sixth degree. For simpler cases, as for SH waves propagating in symmetry planes, the algorithm yields simple analytic solutions. Once the slowness vector is known, determination of energy flux and of other energy quantities is easy. We present numerical examples illustrating the behaviour of the energy-flux vector and other energy quantities, for homogeneous and inhomogeneous plane P, SV and SH waves. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2006 RAS.},

abstract = {The first part of this work analyses the energy balance equation for inhomogeneous time-harmonic waves propagating in a linear anisotropic-viscoelastic medium whose constitutive equation is described by a general time-dependent relaxation matrix of 21 independent components. This matrix includes most linear anisotropic-viscoelastic rheologies and the generalized Hooke's law. The balance of energy allows the identification of the potential and loss energy densities, which are related to the real and imaginary parts of the complex stiffness matrix. The second part establishes some fundamental relations valid for inhomogeneous viscoelastic plane waves. The scalar product between the complex wavenumber and the complex power flow vector is a real quantity proportional to the time-average kinetic energy density. As in the anisotropic-elastic case, it is confirmed that the phase velocity is the projection of the energy velocity vector onto the propagation direction. A similar equation is obtained by replacing the energy velocity with a velocity related to the dissipated energy. Finally, as in isotropic-viscoelastic media, the time-average energy density can be obtained from the projection of the average power flow vector onto the propagation direction, and the time-average dissipated energy density from the projection of the average power flow vector onto the attenuation direction. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {A theory is developed for the propagation of stress waves in a porous elastic solid containing compressible viscous fluid. The emphasis of the present treatment is on materials where fluid and solid are of comparable densities as for instance in the case of water‐saturated rock. The paper denoted here as Part I is restricted to the lower frequency range where the assumption of Poiseuille flow is valid. The extension to the higher frequencies will be treated in Part II. It is found that the material may be described by four nondimensional parameters and a characteristic frequency. There are two dilatational waves and one rotational wave. The physical interpretation of the result is clarified by treating first the case where the fluid is frictionless. The case of a material containing viscous fluid is then developed and discussed numerically. Phase velocity dispersion curves and attenuation coefficients for the three types of waves are plotted as a function of the frequency for various combinations of the c...},

An explicit time stepping staggered-grid finite difference scheme is presented for solving Biot's equations of poroelasticity in this low-frequency limit. A key part of this work is the establishment of rigorous stability conditions. It is demonstrated that over a wide range of porous material properties typical of sedimentary rock and despite the presence of fluid pressure diffusion (Biot slow waves), the usual Courant condition governs the stability as if the problem involved purely elastic waves. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated by comparing to exact analytical solutions for both fast compressional waves and slow waves. Additional numerical modeling examples are also presented.

abstract = {Seismic surveys successfully imaged a small scale CO2 injection (1,600ton) conducted in a brine aquifer of the Frio Formation near Houston, Texas. These time-lapse borehole seismic surveys, crosswell and vertical seismic profile (VSP), were acquired to monitor the CO2 distribution using two boreholes (the new injection well and a pre-existing well used for monitoring) which are 30 m apart at a depth of 1,500 m. The crosswell survey provided a high-resolution image of the CO2 distribution between the wells via tomographic imaging of the P-wave velocity decrease (up to 500 m/s). The simultaneously acquired S-wave tomography showed little change in S-wave velocity, as expected for fluid substitution. A rock physics model was used to estimate CO2 saturations of 10–20\% from the P-wave velocity change. The VSP survey resolved a large (∼70\%) change in reflection amplitude for the Frio horizon. This CO2 induced reflection amplitude change allowed estimation of the CO2 extent beyond the monitor well and on three azimuths. The VSP result is compared with numerical modeling of CO2 saturations and is seismically modeled using the velocity change estimated in the crosswell survey.},

Various types of post-stacks seismic attributes are extracted and analyzed to differentiate payable gas sand from non-payable. The analysis reveals that average instantaneous frequency, peak spectral frequency, average instantaneous phase and sweetness seem to be more effective attributes along with energy half time. Sweetness attribute map shows two sweet spot below the targeted window which indicate to the presence of gas play. Statistical analysis is also carried out to find the associations between seismic attributes and thickness of gas layer values. Cross plots of these attributes were quantified through regression analysis. A good correlation with regression coefficient (R2)>0.78 is found between seismic attributes and gas layer thickness except average instantaneous phase attribute, which lays the foundation for predicting the thickness of gas reservoir.},

abstract = {The mathematical framework for describing plane waves in elastic and linear anelastic media is presented. Theoretical results suggest that the nature of plane waves in anelastic materials is distinctly different from the nature of plane waves in elastic materials. In elastic media the only type of inhomogeneous plane wave (P or S) that can propagate is one for which planes of constant phase are perpendicular to planes of constant amplitude. However, in anelastic media this is the only type of inhomogeneous wave that cannot propagate. For an inhomogeneous P or S plane wave the particle motion is elliptical, the velocity is less than that of a corresponding homogeneous wave, the maximum attenuation is greater than that of a corresponding homogeneous wave, and the direction of maximum energy flow is not the direction of phase propagation. Expressions for the energy flux, energy densities, dissipated energy, stored energy, and Q−1 are derived from an explicit energy conservation relation, valid for an arbitrary steady state viscoelastic radiation field. Each energy expression is valid for homogeneous or inhomogeneous P or S plane waves in elastic or linear anelastic media.},
